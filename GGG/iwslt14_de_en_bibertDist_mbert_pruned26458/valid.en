it ' s that pyramid .
in mother ' s milk .
it had two - to - three - to - 400 times the toxic load ##s ever allowed by the epa .
often what jam ##s us up is se ##wag ##e .
what do you do when you have this sort of dis ##rupted flow ?
stephen pal ##um ##bi : following the mercury trail
i really thought they were so beneath me .
but we didn ' t reali ##ze at the time that we actually needed a third mani ##pula ##tor , because we couldn ' t mani ##pula ##te the neck from inside and walk the horse at the same time .
and now we would like to introduce you to joey .
b ##j : and mike ##y also has , in his fingers , the ability to move the tail from left to right , and up and down with the other hand .
mike ##y brett , craig , leo , zem joaquin and basil and me .
in winter , there ' s a lot of sleeping going on ; you enjoy your family life inside .
the thing to watch for as a global phil ##ant ##hr ##op ##y industry comes about - - and that ' s exactly what is happen ##ing - - is how the asp ##irati ##on is to flip these old ass ##umption ##s , for phil ##ant ##hr ##op ##y to become open and big and fast and connected , in service of the long term .
now , all of these big things for love - - experiments - - aren ' t going to take off .
i ' m going to look quickly at the fourth and fifth categories , which are innovation , competitions and social in ##vesti ##ng .
it may be that the social singular ##ity ahead is the one that we fear the most : a con ##ver ##gence of cat ##ast ##rophe ##s , of environmental degradation , of weapons of mass destruction , of pan ##dem ##ics , of poverty .
i believe that there are new , hidden tensions that are actually happen ##ing between people and institutions - - institutions that are the institutions that people in ##hab ##it in their daily life : schools , hospitals , work ##place ##s , factories , offices , etc .
the first gentleman , he ' s a baker .
so , think of the three settings i ' ve talk ##ed to you about : factory , migration , office .
they were living on top of the workshops where they were working .
so , how many of you have ever gott ##en behind the wheel of a car when you really should ##n ' t have been driving ?
one of the things that we ' ve developed in the lab - - we ' ve developed several vehicles - - is what we believe is the world ' s first autonomous ##ly drift ##ing car .
now , clearly we ' re not going to put a couple of electro ##des on his head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track .
watch the mental work ##load , and watch the ste ##ering .
so today , i ' m going to tell you about some people who didn ' t move out of their neighborhood ##s .
so a few years ago , l . a . county decided that they needed to spend 2 . 5 billion dollars to repair the city schools .
i mean , literally , her hometown is called white ##sville , west virginia .
so these three guys all understand how to product ##ivel ##y channel dollars through our local economie ##s to meet existing market demands , reduce the social problems that we have now and prevent new problems in the future .
our municipalities , rural and urban , play the operational course of infrastructure - - things like waste dis ##posa ##l , energy demand , as well as social costs of une ##mp ##lo ##yment , drop - out rates , inca ##rce ##ration rates and the impacts of various public health costs .
and reading that book made me re ##ex ##amine that theory because i need to explain what i mean by that .
and i think because early on , frank ##ly , my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time .
and my question is , how did we get from there to here ?
i went to deaf clubs .
and yet , we have nobody who is trying to ensure that the next generation of children born to african - americans and asian ##s come out with cream ##y skin and yellow hair .
and he ended up achieving at a level that had never before been contem ##pla ##ted by any member of his family .
the experience of down syndrome people includes those who are actors , those who are writers , some who are able to live fully independently in adult ##hood .
and a lot of the time the question of parent ##hood is , what do we valida ##te in our children , and what do we cure in them ?
and ultimately i feel that in the same way that we test flame - ret ##arda ##nt paj ##amas in an inferno to ensure they won ' t catch fire when our child reaches across the sto ##ve , so these stories of families nego ##tia ##ting these extreme differences reflect on the universal experience of parent ##ing , which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think , where did you come from ?
and he had a very large head , which she thought might indicate hydro ##cephalus .
and i came from a very pri ##vil ##eged background . i was very lucky .
never shown this picture before , and probably going to be sue ##d for it .
the point being , this is going to be very , very intensive on the programming side .
you want a separate thing , like the ac ada ##ptor .
if you ' re in a desert , they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart .
not something you ' d en ##vy or want to do .
and it ' s not to go out and buy 100 or 1 , 000 , though , i invite you to do that , and 10 , 000 would be even better .
and there are days - - i don ' t know about the rest of you guys - - but there are days when i pal ##pa ##bly feel how much i re ##ly on other people for pretty much everything in my life .
so actually now on this website , we have 18 , 000 people .
and we ' re building upon innovations of generations who went before us .
but remember , greece is there today .
and when you think about the economy through these two different lens ##es , you understand why this crisis is so hard to solve , because the worse the crisis gets , the higher the stakes are , the more each side think ##s they know the answer and the other side is just going to ruin everything .
that ' s 20 percent of the budget , and that presents a more difficult issue .
the phrase that you want , if you ' re a graduate student or a post ##doc or you ' re a professor , a 38 - year - old economics professor , is , " i ' m an em ##pi ##rici ##st .
we know what it ' s like to have these people on tv , in congress , ye ##lling about how the end of the world is coming if we don ' t adopt their view completely , because it ' s happened about the dollar ever since there ' s been a dollar .
and he said to the guy , " why have you put stuff on the back that no one will ever see ? "
i thought , well that ' s not good enough .
the wir ##ing from your sensor ##y app ##arat ##us to those bits is shorter than the bits that have to pass through the think ##y bit , the cortex .
where are you feeling this ?
and also triumph , this sense of trans ##cend ##ence , this " i never knew that . ah , this is something new . "
so i ' m going to shame ##less ##ly expose something to you , which is beautiful to me .
and then i can ' t tell you how hard it is to do that radia ##tor , which is curve ##d .
no one ' s going to notice those split lines and changes .
but what i have to do now , feeling again , what i ' ve got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzyme ##s , of these trigger ##s into something early on in the process , that you pick it up , not through your thinking , but through your feeling .
no time . it says i have two minutes left , so we can ' t do this .
now i think it ' s too easy .
we have secular ##ized badly , i would argue .
we need data , we don ' t need help .
you need to keep repeat ##ing the lesson 10 times a day .
this comes across also in the way in which religions set up ritual ##s around important feelings .
and when they teach us a lesson , they do it via the body .
but that feeling of puzzle ##ment is structural to contemporary art .
the people in the modern world , in the secular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher soul - like concerns , tend to be isolated individuals .
if you want to change the world , you have to group together , you have to be collaborative .
and i say , " of course . " and they say , " so aren ' t you sort of religious ? "
because you ' ve agreed on 90 percent of things , because you have a shared view on so many things , and you poli ##tely differ .
so it took me from places like chile - - the ataca ##ma desert in chile - - to siberia , to underground mines in the japanese alps , in northern america , all the way to antarctica and even to the south pole .
you need something like ten ##s of mega ##tons of water - - almost a gi ##gato ##n of water - - in order to have any chance of catch ##ing this neu ##tri ##no .
the toile ##ts there are literally holes in the ground covered with a wooden sha ##ck .
so this is us landing on the ross ice she ##lf in antarctica .
the fabric alone wei ##gh ##s two tons .
ani ##l ana ##nth ##as ##wa ##my : what it takes to do extreme astrophysics
well , first you have to , as an engineer , scope the problem . how big is it ?
and a book ##mo ##bile - - the size of a van with a satellite dish , a print ##er , bind ##er and cut ##ter , and kids make their own books .
we have one of these things now . it ' s completely cool .
but we sent - - thought , ok , if we ' re going to need to do this , let ' s do it in - library .
the gett ##y here is moving their books to the ucla , which is where we have one these sc ##anning centers , and sc ##anning their out - of - copyright books , which is fab ##ulous .
it costs about 10 dollars a piece to go and take a disk and put it online , if you ' re doing things in volume .
we tende ##d towards longer - term things and also things that people can reus ##e and make into new movies , which has just been great fun .
so any ##way , you ' ve got basica ##lly an idea of where things came from .
so en ##vision what it looks like all wr ##apped up .
it looked more like this when it was all wr ##apped up - - not quite so pretty .
and frank ##ly , i face a big ob ##sta ##cle .
but these are essentially external ##ized sto ##mach ##s and lung ##s .
so , fungi and my ##celi ##um se ##ques ##ter carbon dio ##xide in the form of calcium o ##xa ##lates .
the my ##celi ##um , in the right conditions , produces a mus ##hr ##oom - - it bur ##sts through with such fer ##oci ##ty that it can break asp ##halt .
and i ' ll show you a graph here .
there ' s a vette ##d press release that you can read - - it ' s vette ##d by dod - - if you google " stam ##ets " and " small ##po ##x . "
so , the house is no longer suitable for invasion .
too many withdrawal ##s from the carbon bank , and so this population will be shut down .
so we had our own miniature rain ##for ##est , a private beach with a coral reef .
so eight of us went in : four men and four women .
we stopped ir ##riga ##ting our soil , as much as we could .
but on the other hand , it was the scientific gold of the project , because we could really cr ##ank this baby up , as a scientific tool , and see if we could , in fact , find where those seven tons of oxygen had gone .
i had been growing all my own food .
and all of it was coming from this : shri ##mp farms .
it ' s such a huge subject . "
and if you lose where you are in your bio ##sp ##here , or are perhaps having a difficulty connecting with where you are in the bio ##sp ##here , i would say to you , take a deep breath .
the cause of our troubles is actually the complexity that science has given us .
we have now found treatment ##s for nearly all of the ten ##s of thousands of conditions that a human being can have .
there ' s another sign that we need pit crews , and that ' s the un ##mana ##gea ##ble cost of our care .
skill number one is the ability to recognize success and the ability to recognize failure .
we got the lead safety engineer for boeing to help us .
there ' s a deep resistance because using these tools forces us to con ##front that we ' re not a system , forces us to be ##hav ##e with a different set of values .
and most of those losses are because of things we know .
if you don ' t just want a queen , you can buy , actually , a three - pound package of bees , which comes in the mail , and of course , the postal office is always very concerned when they get , you know , your three - pound package ##s of bees .
but if you ' re losing 50 percent to 80 percent of your colonies , you can ' t survive three years in a row . and we ' re really wo ##rri ##ed about losing this segment of our industry .
and bees are very faithful .
and of course , bees are not the only important factor here .
but i also want to rein ##force some of the ideas we ' ve heard here , because having a meadow or living by a meadow is transformation ##al .
well actually , i ' ve [ been ] w ##his ##tli ##ng since the age of four , about four .
i lost my face .
and i want to first re ##hea ##rse with you your w ##his ##tli ##ng .
some of them are very easy .
and they also are able to show and to exhibit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence .
look at this young bean that is moving to catch the light every time .
how is it possible to do this without a brain ?
and why are they so similar ?
thank you .
they ' re going to be entering this car one by one .
and also in 50 other cities around the world , people participated .
and because it was in union square park , right by a subway station , there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing .
they ' re wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt .
he gave 2 , 000 high five ##s that day , and he wash ##ed his hands before and after ##ward and did not get sick .
and not knowing where help was needed always ensure ##d that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most .
our goal over the next year is to get water canary ready for the field and to open - source the hardware so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evaluation , so we can tackle this problem together .
now why am i talking about cow ##s ?
so what i ' m propos ##ing is , just as we require reading , writing , ari ##th ##metic , american history , so we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world - - about their history , about their creed ##s , about their texts , their music , their symbol ##ism ##s , their pro ##hibition ##s , their requirements .
all i ' m saying is - - facts . facts only .
except , of course , it wasn ' t the sheep ' s cle ##vern ##ess .
the lesson we learn from this is you don ' t have to have a mind to be a bene ##fici ##ary .
and how can we do that ?
i ' m talking also about christianity .
yes .
but i wish it were better .
and here i think , " wait a minute . "
well , this from " the purpose driven life " - - " the bible must become the author ##itati ##ve standard for my life , the comp ##ass i re ##ly on for direction , the counsel i listen to for making wise decisions and the bench ##mark i use for eva ##lua ##ting everything . "
now do we really want to com ##mit ours ##el ##ves to eng ##ulf ##ing all the other religions when their holy books are telling them , " don ' t listen to the other side , that ' s just satan talking ! "
ear ##s are made not for hearing , but for listening .
it looks a bit like this .
if you can ' t hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice , it ' s too loud .
first of all , listen con ##scio ##usly .
and my relationship to especially human - made objects which someone else said they work like this , well , i can say they work a different way , a little bit .
so kids don ' t have as hard of a time with this , and i saw in my own son , i gave him this book .
and then you can take the little piano circuit off the pen ##cil .
and so we ' re like , " we gotta put a video out about this . "
oka ##y , just wait for this one . this is good .
it ' s really going to be seven billion pairs of hands , each following their own passion ##s , and each kind of like a mosaic coming up and creating this world in their back ##yard ##s and in their kitchen ##s .
but they won ' t come to us directly through light .
but einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical odd ##ity .
it would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn ' t , any ##more than light can escape .
this is from my group - - a slightly less gl ##amo ##rous computer modeling .
and sure ##ly , somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged .
galaxies form , and generations of stars form in those galaxies , and around one star , at least one star , is a habita ##ble planet .
so we have to wonder , if there is a multi ##verse , in some other patch of that multi ##verse , are there creatures ?
of the 100 inca ##rce ##rated people that are released , 60 will return to prison .
well , it has its pluse ##s and minus ##es .
from the fact that they are only serving one audience , mainly the western culture .
i go every ##w ##here to make believe it ' s iran .
now comes the green movement - - the summer of 2009 , as my film is released - - the uprising begins in the streets of tehran .
it can ' t af ##ford to doubt the person who tend ##s the child .
one person wins .
i will come to it later .
you cannot command comp ##ass ##ion unless you become limit ##less , and nobody can become limit ##less , either you are or you are not . period .
you act comp ##ass ##iona ##tely .
if this does not blow your mind , then you have no emotion .
and let ' s pause here .
it ' s good for motiv ##ated students .
in a traditional classroom , you have a couple of home ##work , home ##work , lecture , home ##work , lecture , and then you have a sna ##ps ##hot ex ##am .
and you can go to the site right now . it ' s all free . not trying to sell anything .
red means they ' re stuck .
and we ' re seeing it over and over and over again .
i ' m still doing all the videos , but we have a rocks ##tar team doing the software .
and they ' re literally saying , " hey , this is nice , but . . . " like that focus graph , a lot of the teachers said , " i have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic . "
but there are also hall ##uci ##nation ##s as well , and hall ##uci ##nation ##s are completely different .
i see a lot of children . they are walking up and down sta ##irs .
i said , " there is a special form of visual hall ##uci ##nation which may go with det ##eri ##ora ##ting vision or blind ##ness .
the first thing he said was he saw a hand ##ker ##chie ##f in mida ##ir .
and he turned around . and then he divided into six figures in strip ##ed shirt ##s , who started walking towards her .
but no more than one percent of the people ac ##k ##now ##led ##ge them , because they are afraid they will be seen as insan ##e or something .
when people have these simple geo ##metrica ##l hall ##uci ##nation ##s , the primary visual cortex is activated .
it is only if one is visual ##ly imp ##aire ##d or blind that the process is inter ##rupted .
and actually i ' m a little visual ##ly imp ##aire ##d myself .
but i would come back from those dive ##s and try to share the experience with words , and they were totally ina ##de ##quate to the task .
it ' s un ##beli ##eva ##ble .
this looks like something out of a dr . seus ##s book - - just all manner of creatures all over this thing .
and we view it with a camera system i developed called eye - in - the - sea that uses far red light that ' s invisible to most animals , so it ' s uno ##bt ##rus ##ive .
and it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electronic je ##lly ##fish .

the yellow - green area is the fluid ##s of blood , which is mostly water , but it ' s also anti ##bod ##ies , sugar ##s , hormone ##s , that kind of thing .
it ' s an accurate representation , and it ' s pretty much at the correct speed for what is occurring inside you .
one set of dna goes to one side , the other side gets the other set of dna - - identical copies of dna .
it ' s able to feel when the cell is ready , when the chromosome is correct ##ly position ##ed .
humanity is now fully into the techno - scientific age .
during 41 years of teaching biology at harvard , i watched sad ##ly as bright students turned away from the possibility of a scientific career or even from taking non - required courses in science because they were afraid of failure .
judge opportunity by how few other students and researchers are on hand .
or larger , what ' s the role of dark matter in the expansion of the universe ?
humans have lived for much , much longer than the approximately 10 , 000 years of settled agricultural civilization in small family groups . nom ##adi ##c hunters bring down rabbit ##s , gathering food .
more recently , that power is un ##tet ##her ##ing and leap ##ing off the desktop ##s , and very , very quickly , we ' re going to see a significant proportion , if not the majority of the human race , walking around holding , carrying or wearing super ##com ##put ##ers linked at speed ##s greater than what we consider to be broad ##band today .
he used the example of a common graz ##ing area in which each person by simply maxim ##izing their own fl ##ock led to over ##gra ##zing and the de ##ple ##tion of the resource .
toyota , instead of treat ##ing its suppl ##iers as a market ##place , treat ##s them as a network and trains them to produce better , even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors .
what forms of suffering could be alle ##via ##ted , what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about cooperation ?
now , i ' ll show you a fun app that - - we ' ve been working on a collaboration with our friends at fl ##ick ##r .
yeah , yeah , back to the corner , back to the corner .
blaise ag ##uera y arca ##s : augmente ##d - reality maps
this was in preparation for a merger and acquisition .
and if you remember the story about sis ##yp ##hus , sis ##yp ##hus was pun ##ished by the gods to push the same rock up a hill , and when he almost got to the end , the rock would roll over , and he would have to start again .
what happened ?
i said , " how many of you now go home earlier than you used to ? "
so you take a piece , you just put it on the side .
the next part i want to show you is something about the positive motivation .
you had to measure the milk and add it , mixing it .
at the top of the sheet , we had little diagram ##s of how do you fold ori ##gami .
by the way , these are my kids , which , of course , are wonderful and so on .
and we ' re actually cambodia ##ns .
this is a picture of what pur ##sat looks like .
but for us it meant freedom .
one day a man told me , " my future does not look brilliant , but i want to have a brilliant future for my son . "
so the key here is empat ##hy .
we revised the mental health component of the primary health care services by adding psycho - social care and psycho - social counsel ##ors to the system .
when jung ##ian anal ##yst inge miss ##mah ##l visited afghanistan , she saw the inner wound ##s of war - - widespread des ##pai ##r , trauma and depression . and yet , in this county of 30 million people , there were only two dozen ps ##ych ##iat ##rist ##s . miss ##mah ##l talks about her work helping to build the country ' s system of psycho ##so ##cial counsel ##ing , promoting both individual and , perhaps , national healing .
that ' s true of european bio ##fu ##els .
top left , we have canada and australia , with eno ##rm ##ous land areas , very high per capita consumption , 200 or 300 light bu ##lb ##s per person , and very low population dens ##ities .
wind power produces a bit more , 2 . 5 watts per square meter , but that ' s only twice as big as 1 . 25 watts per square meter , so that means if you wanted literally to produce total energy consumption in all forms on average from wind farms , you need wind farms half the area of the u . k .
but the same goes for rene ##wa ##bles as well .
next , there ' s the heat ##ing lever .
so , if you wanted to get 16 light bu ##lb ##s , remember , today our total energy consumption is 125 light bu ##lb ##s ' worth .
he mentioned four great world orchestra ##s , and the fifth one was venezuela ' s youth symphony orchestra .
the structure of el sistema is based on a new and flexible managing style adapted to the features of each community and region , and today attend ##s to 300 , 000 children of the lower and middle class all over venezuela .
from the minute a child ' s taught how to play an instrument , he ' s no longer poor .
think about it , all right ? i ' m going to answer the phone three different times .
behavioral marker ##s matter .
that actually occurred this year . she took early retirement .
we are ob ##ses ##sed with this way of thinking .
classic . hip frac ##ture often leads to institutional ##ization of a senior .
these discover ##ies of behavioral marker ##s , and behavioral changes are game changing , and like the discovery of the micro ##scope because of our collecting data streams that we ' ve actually never done before .
it ' s ach ##ie ##vable . we should do it economica ##lly , we should do it moral ##ly , and we should do it for quality of life .
we will see 30 , 000 new infected websites .
this is the market leader in mal ##ware distribution , the black hole ex ##plo ##it pack , responsible for nearly one third of mal ##ware distribution in the last couple of quarters .
so this is writing out the mali ##cious code , and a few seconds later , on the left - hand side , you ' ll see the attack ##er ' s screen get some interesting new text .
what ' s really ins ##ult ##ing about this is not only does it provide the attack ##ers with access to your data , but when the sc ##an finish ##es , they tell you in order to clean up the fake virus ##es , you have to register the product .
a little more searching , and here ' s our cyber ##c ##rimi ##nal .
oka ##y ? so you can see a list of wireless networks .
you see , technology ' s changing at a sta ##gger ##ing rate , and that 250 , 000 pieces of mal ##ware won ' t stay the same for long .
i wasn ' t very good at reading things .
you all know the story , right .
and that was really cool .
it was extraordinary .
" you can call it a dinosaur , but look at the velo ##cir ##ap ##tor : the velo ##cir ##ap ##tor is cool . "
and they obvious ##ly make a lot of money off of them .
and so he agreed .
and quite frank ##ly , i think if colonel sanders was to be care ##ful how he word ##ed it , he could actually ad ##vert ##ise an extra piece .
that ' s based on diet int ##ake surveys , it ' s based on levels of obe ##sity , it ' s based on a range of factors that gives you an app ##rox ##imate gu ##ess as to how much food is actually going into people ' s mouth ##s .
that ' s what ' s in fields around the world every single year .
go one step up , and you get to farmers , who throw away sometimes a third or even more of their harvest because of cos ##metic standards .
the one in the middle , on my kitchen table . not much difference .
western countries throw out nearly half of their food , not because it ' s ine ##di ##ble - - but because it doesn ' t look appeal ##ing . tris ##tra ##m stuart del ##ves into the shock ##ing data of waste ##d food , calling for a more responsible use of global resources .
and this is all done , by the way , by the international astronomical union .
now , we ' re going to be going to mars one day . and when we do , it ' s going to be un ##fair for the people that are living there to have to live with these rid ##icu ##lou ##s names .
" listen , i ' m going back to the swamp mer ##maid . can you call me in a little while ? "
we have names for places where people don ' t exist .

it just seems like it ' s not sexy and elegant , it ' s hidden .
thank you .
it was inc ##redi ##bly successful .
it thought of itself as being disco ##nne ##cted from the internet , but it was possible for somebody to sm ##ug ##gle a usb drive in there , or something like that , and software got in there that causes the centri ##fu ##ges , in that case , to actually destroy themselves .
and so if you hear an expert talking about the internet and saying it can do this , or it does do this , or it will do that , you should treat it with the same sk ##ept ##ici ##sm that you might treat the comments of an economist about the economy or a weather ##man about the weather , or something like that .
good afternoon .
so military technologies can influence the course of the world , can make or break world peace - - and there lies the issue with cyber weapons .
today we ' re moving to a multi ##pol ##ar world in which coordination is much more complicated , as we have seen at copenhagen .
before that day , this is how i saw the ocean .
speaking of dinosaurs , sharks are basica ##lly the same fish they were 300 million years ago .
of course , sea cuc ##um ##bers shoot them out their rear ##s , which , in my opinion , makes them much more interesting a super ##hero .

i couldn ' t fit them in .

722 is 500 - - oo ##h , that ' s a harder one .
in the meanwhile , let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trick ##ier .
ok , any six of them .
audience : february .
what year , chris , would you like ?
audience : six . six .
now , 57 times 68 is 3 , 400 , plus 476 is 387 ##6 , that ' s 38 , 760 plus 171 , 38 , 760 plus 171 is 38 , 931 .
a third time , it ' s just being a tech ##nici ##an .
change is happen ##ing , and the change that is happen ##ing is not one that is in software .
had collected photographs of me , as mothers will do .
and i ' ll just say what i ' m about to do . what i ' m about to do - - i hope you can recognize that there ' s a dis ##tor ##ted sine wave , almost a triangular wave upon this he ##wl ##ett - packard os ##cil ##los ##cope .
but you will need to know eighth - grade algebra , and we ' re going to do serious experiments .
now , so i know the frequency .
i ' m going home for a midt ##erm . a riot ' s going on on campus .

and it will be sub - orbital . and the reason it has to be sub - orbital is , there is not solutions for ad ##e ##quate safety to fly the public to orbit . the governments have been doing this - - three governments have been doing this for 45 years , and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died .
these people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area , and i think it ' s a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something - - but they ' re putting it in very - - areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability , and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore . and i think eventually it will allow us to colon ##ize and to keep us from going extinct .
100 million bucks - - hey , i can go to the moon .
the technology revolution is opening the world .
now , what is open ##ness ?
he viewed talent different ##ly .
now , the third meaning and corresponding principle of open ##ness is about sharing .
social media didn ' t create the revolution ; it was created by a new generation of young people who wanted jobs and hope and who didn ' t want to be treated as subjects any ##more .
people didn ' t know about things .
it protect ##s the birds .
so why should we care about blood vessels ?
so here we go .
in effect , when we give cancer patients anti ##ang ##io ##geni ##c therapy - - here , an experimental drug for a gli ##oma , which is a type of brain tumor - - you can see that there are dramatic changes that occur when the tumor is being star ##ved .
and , in fact , the first pioneer ##ing treatment ##s for people , as well as dogs , are already becoming available .
the active ing ##redi ##ent ' s res ##vera ##tro ##l , it ' s also found in red wine .
now , i ' ve shown you a bun ##ch of lab data , and so the real question is : what is the evidence in people that eating certain foods can reduce ang ##io ##genes ##is in cancer ?
the really , truly interesting thing about this is that we can ' t take these obe ##se mice and make them lose more weight than what the normal mouse ' s weight is supposed to be .
for the last 20 years i ' ve been design ##ing puzzle ##s .
went on , and eventually decided to dev ##ote myself , full time , to that .
the artist m . c . esch ##er ex ##plo ##ited that in some of his wonderful prints .
well , let ' s first of all sim ##pli ##fy the vase ##s illusion , make the thing on the right .
the first move is going to be what ?
but it takes some pers ##isten ##ce .
why ? well , we ag ##ing boom ##ers , baby boom ##ers , we ' re eating our healthy food , we ' re ex ##er ##cisi ##ng . what about our minds ?
that ' s his hair . you get a lot of figure - ground problems .
i think the whole world has essentially been brought up not to be a girl .
their stories were so hor ##rif ##ic , and so mind - blow ##ing and so on the other side of human existence , that to be perfect ##ly hon ##est with you , i was sha ##ttere ##d .
i ' ve traveled , as i said , to many , many countries , and i ' ve seen , if we do what we do to the girl inside us then obvious ##ly it ' s hor ##rif ##ic to think what we do to girls in the world .
i know a 14 - year - old girl in the netherlands , for example , who is demand ##ing that she take a boat and go around the entire world by herself .
she taught girls what a healthy vag ##ina looked like , and what a mut ##ila ##ted vag ##ina looked like .
and when she got to the house she was gre ##ete ##d .
it ' s all bad . my brothers get everything . "
i re ##jo ##ice that it ' s still in my body .
thank you very much .
sent to prison , adama ##nt ##ly ins ##isti ##ng on his innocence , which he has consistently for 21 years .
this is looking directly across the street from where they were standing .
some of the teenager ##s said that in fact the car was 15 feet away when it shot .
and what does this example - - what ' s important to keep in mind for ours ##el ##ves ?
and this ble ##w his mind . literally . he check ##ed into a san ##itar ##ium .
so nature has this self - similar structure .
well , i notice ##d that line is about where the only square building in the village is at .
first of all , i agree with mud ##im ##be ' s wonderful book , " the invention of africa , " that africa is an artificial invention of first colonial ##ism , and then opposition ##al movements .
here ' s a wonderful frac ##tal .
and one of them said , " come here . i think i can help you out here . "
so let me end with just a few words about applications that we ' ve found for this .
so if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work , we need look only no far ##ther than africa to find these rob ##ust self - organizing algorithms .
at 7 p . m . on a sunday in hidden springs , idaho , where the six members of the starr family are sitting down to the high ##light of their week : the family meeting .
he read 30 years of harvard business review before stu ##mb ##ling upon an article in 1986 called " the new new product development game . "
he said , " you can ' t under ##esti ##mate the power of doing this . "
it felt like we were kind of lay ##ing these underground cables that would ##n ' t light up their world for many years to come .
we ' ll have family breakfast . we ' ll meet for a bed ##time sna ##ck .
so we said , " oka ##y , give us a reward and give us a punishment . oka ##y ? "
jim collins , the author of " good to great , " told me that successful human organizations of any kind have two things in common : they preserve the core , they sti ##mula ##te progress .
researchers at em ##ory gave children a simple " what do you know " test .
that story perfect ##ly capture ##s for me the final lesson that i learned : happiness is not something we find , it ' s something we make .
a winds ##hie ##ld coat ##ing is going to give you about 110 degrees .
and i ' m going to leave you with one last demonstration , but before i do that , i would like to say thank you , and think small .
and that was that she did two entire shows promoting that movie " the secret . "
when a word was mentioned , an image of it instant ##ly appeared in his mind .
a world telegraph ##y center - - imagine news , messages , sounds , images delivered to any point in the world instant ##ly and wireless ##ly .
it ' s been around for about 7 , 000 years .
again , we are making holes in the skull about the size of a dim ##e , putting an electro ##de in , and then this electro ##de is completely under ##nea ##th the skin down to a pace ##maker in the chest , and with a remote control very much like a television remote control , we can ad ##jus ##t how much electricity we deliver to these areas of the brain .
so here he is .
so we went ahead and imp ##lante ##d electro ##des in patients with depression .
and indeed , at the top , you ' ll see before the surgery , the areas in blue are the areas that use less glucose than normal , predominantly the pari ##eta ##l and temporal lo ##bes .
i get to do this all the time , and it ' s just incredible .
and they can be modele ##d by a spring - mass system that we call the spring mass system because we ' re bio ##me ##chan ##ists . it ' s actually a po ##go stick .
this is a collaboration we have with stanford .
we couldn ' t believe that it could do this . it said to us that if you could build a robot with very simple , spring ##y legs , you could make it as mane ##uve ##rable as any that ' s ever been built .
like if we had a piece of tape now , we ' d peel it this way .
but that ' s what we ' re limited to , at the moment .
and just recently we ' ve made a breakthrough , where we now believe we ' re going to be able to create the first synthetic , self - clean ##ing , dry ad ##hes ##ive . many companies are interested in this .
we also have another problem , which is that women face harder choice ##s between professional success and personal fu ##lf ##ill ##ment .
i don ' t have the right answer .
he reads one book of 12 and goes to a couple of lectures , marches himself up to our room a couple days before the ex ##am to get himself tutor ##ed .
but it ' s not that simple .
and she said , " i learned something today .
message number three : don ' t leave before you leave .
they ' re just not moving .
when people don ' t take their pil ##ls , when people don ' t follow doctors ' orders - - these are behavior problems .
they would get dent ##ures , and if you got dent ##ures , you were ##n ' t going to be able to eat corn - on - the - co ##b , you ' ll eat mus ##h for the rest of your life .
this is still the way we ' re commun ##icat ##ing messages about health .
we should probably slow down , and that point of action is probably now .
this is an approach that has been developed by a couple researchers at dartmouth medical school , lisa schwartz and steven wol ##osh ##in .
so that ' s what i want to walk you through .
so we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well .
but we ' re not using it . it ' s just sitting there .
i want to say a word for nature because we haven ' t talk ##ed that much about it the last couple days .
the bee is not calling the shots .
ug ##h . mini - me .
now , the other use of this is practical .
he wait ##s three days , and then we to ##wed in something called the egg ##mo ##bile .
and the species in the soil go to work basica ##lly che ##wing through those roots , deco ##mp ##osing them - - the earth ##worm ##s , the fungi , the bacteria - - and the result is new soil .
and so i say that i want to build a game layer on top of the world , but that ' s not quite true because it ' s already under construction ; it ' s already happen ##ing .
and if you ' re happy with that , fantastic .
so the first one - - the most famous appointment dynamic in the world - - is something called happy hour .
you should get points for doing this on time .
why go from an a to an f or a b to a c ?
and we ' ve introduced a progression dynamic into it , where , by going to the same place over and over , by doing challenges , by eng ##aging with the business , you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen , and you eventually un ##lock reward ##s .
this next decade is the decade of games .
so you can see : here we are in the u . s . , and they ' re all coming up red .
and if we can switch to slide ##s - - all right , here we go .
they run google ad ##s , and we just give them the ad credit so they can let organizations know .
you can see , even though the u . s . is still the majority here - - though , by the way , search - wise , it ' s only about 30 percent of our traffic - - but it ' s already going to japan , and the u . k . , and europe , and all the rest of the countries .
i think usually , as companies get bigger , they find it really hard to have small , innovative projects .
fr ##oog ##le let ##s you search shopping information , and blog ##ger let ##s you publish things .
but the idea is , like , on a newspaper , for example , we show you relevant ad ##s .
so , " related search ##es , " right there . you can ' t see it that well , but we decided we should put in this feature into our ad ##sens ##e ad ##s , called " related search ##es . "
now this rather old photo up there is actually the first project i was ever hired to do , something like 25 years ago .
and to do that meant creating the flat ##test gradi ##ents that had ever yet been made , which meant building long via ##duct ##s across river valley ##s - - this is actually the via ##duct across the thames at maiden ##head - - and long tunnels such as the one at box , in wiltshire .
what makes technology useful and usa ##ble ?
and instead of instal ##ling the large - scale machines used by western producers , they used low - cost cad / cam prototyp ##ing technology .
now the industrial systems of brune ##l ' s time have run their course , and indeed they are part of the problem today .
so for me , this project shows kind of how far we can go from some of those sort of small things that i was working on at the beginning of my career .
in response , he gave me an even more courte ##ous version of the same explanation .
people must choose for themselves , sometimes stick ##ing to their guns , regardless of what other people want or rec ##ommen ##d .
the ass ##umption then that we do best when the individual self choose ##s only holds when that self is clearly divided from others .
of course , you and i know that cok ##e is the better choice .
it ' s not a marker of liberation , but of su ##ffo ##cation by meaning ##less minuti ##ae .
in france , the doctors decided whether and when the life support would be removed , while in the united states , the final decision reste ##d with the parents .
but the history books and the daily news tell us it doesn ' t always work out that way .
and so one time i was in a beauty salon , and i was trying to decide between two very light shade ##s of pink .
she ##ena i ##yen ##gar studies how we make choice ##s - - and how we feel about the choice ##s we make . at ted ##glo ##bal , she talks about both tri ##via ##l choice ##s and prof ##oun ##d ones , and shares her ground ##break ##ing research that has un ##covered some sur ##pris ##ing attitudes about our decisions .
then i was so happy that i kept playing with the robot , and so you see the robot has a front rud ##der here .
so i brought to you for the first time on the ted stage pro ##tei number eight . it ' s not the last one , but it ' s a good one for making demos .
this is a proud member of pro ##tei from korea , and on the right side , this is a multiple - mast ##s design proposed by a team in mexico .
when senior fellow cesar harad ##a heard about the deva ##stat ##ing effects of the bp oil sp ##ill in the gulf of mexico in 2010 , he quit his dream job and moved to new orleans to develop a more efficient way to soa ##k up the oil . he designed a highly mane ##uve ##rable , flexible boat capable of clean ##ing large tract ##s quickly . but rather than turn a profit , he has op ##ted to open - source the design .
ph : there ' s been an une ##asy relationship between the tv business and the tech business , really ever since they both turned about 30 .
i mean , how did a machine that was built for accounting and artillery mor ##ph into media ?
enter the atomic bomb .
and then , the 92 nuclear power plants that it would take to provide the power would fill up the rest of los angeles .
then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set , and ru ##b it out from the center to the corners , like this .
if you substitute the word blog ##os ##phe ##re , of the internet today , it is very true that his understanding is probably very en ##light ##ening now . let ' s listen in to him .
and into that ferme ##nt came the micro ##pro ##cesso ##r .
this method allows you to use existing video ##dis ##c materials in ways which suit your specific needs and interests .
in 1939 , the radio corporation of america introduced television .
it ' s a customer , it ' s an audience , it ' s a person who ' s participating .
voice 2 : well , there goes the neighborhood .
and so every time a new medium arrives , the old medium is the content , and it is highly observa ##ble , highly notice ##able , but the real , real rough ##ing up and massa ##ging is done by the new medium , and it is ign ##ored .
i was walking around on the streets of amsterdam and i recognized , you know , the big story from amsterdam isn ' t what ' s in the design stores , it ' s what ' s out on the streets , and maybe it ' s self - ex ##plan ##ator ##y , but a city that has ##n ' t been taken over by moderni ##sm , that ' s preserved its kind of architecture and character , and where the bicycle plays an important part of the way in which people get around and where pe ##dest ##rian rights are protected .
it takes your attention ; it has a great amount of emotion ; it stare ##s back at you the way that a figure might .
the dutch are good also , but the italians are good .
and i do think pattern has the capability of era ##dica ##ting some of the most evil forces of society , such as bad form in restaurants , but quite seriously , it was a statement to me that one thing that you do , sort of , see is the aggressive nature of the industrial world has produced - - kind of , large masses of things , and when you - - in mono ##cul ##ture , and i think the preservation of diversity in culture is something that ' s important to us .
rob forbes , the founder of design within reach , shows a gallery of sna ##ps ##hot ##s that infor ##m his way of seeing the world . char ##ming ju ##xt ##apo ##siti ##ons , found art , urban patterns - - this slide ##show will open your eyes to the world around you .
so i built model airplane ##s .
and for the following 25 years , living in italy , living in america , i dole ##d out a piece of this romance to any ##body who ' d pay for it - - this sense , this aes ##thetic feeling , for the experience rev ##ol ##ving around a designed object .
and that ' s the way i work now .
he reached down . he pulled a lever . and the chair sank down .
would everybody put their hand under their bottom and feel their tail ##bone ?
ideal ##ly you want to put the head support in the cr ##ania ##l area , right there .
now let ' s assume you go on holiday .
that ' s two days ago .
clearly the product you ' ve got has got to be safe to humans .
a single female will lay about up to 100 eggs at a time , up to about 500 in her lifetime .
so freight costs aren ' t our biggest problem .
i found myself in a hospital in an intensive - care ward , recu ##pera ##ting from emergency surgery .
so , it ' s not really simple when somebody asks you , " where do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?
no doctor , can i remember , ever asking me , " where have you lived ? "
and all of those black dot ##s are all of the toxic release inventor ##ies that are monitor ##ed by the epa .
and i would say he got it right almost a decade ago .
i am the emperor of orange ##s . i am the emperor of orange ##s . "
i ' m going to start by asking you a question : is anyone familiar with the blue al ##gae problem ?
cell membrane ##s are pho ##sp ##horus - based : these are called pho ##sp ##hol ##ip ##ids .
you ' re going to tell me it ' s waste ##ful .
what are we to do ? we are faced with a paradox .
and over time , this mus ##hr ##oom has evolved and adapted to seek out even the tin ##iest trace of pho ##sp ##horus , and to put it to use , to make it available to the plant .
my ##cor ##rh ##iza was used in one field but not in the other .
so , examples like christopher wr ##en ' s king ' s cross : you can see that the structural forces of the vault ##ing get arti ##cula ##ted as lines , so you ' re really actually seeing the expression of structural force and form .
now , typically you ' d think that they would all be the same : like , the chair ##s you ' re sitting in would all be the same dimension .
and here we ' ve broken the 500 apartments up into small neighborhood ##s , and differenti ##ated those neighborhood ##s .
that way , each one of these tools we could pay for with a few hundred dollars , and get incredible variation in the components .
finally , i ' d like to just show you some of the effects of using digital fabrication .
if we go a little bit further south in our little tour of the world , we can go to the bolivia ##n edge of the amazon , here also in 1975 , and if you look really care ##fully , there ' s a thin white line through that kind of sea ##m , and there ' s a lone farmer out there in the middle of the prime ##val jungle .
well , the colorado on a typical day in the 1950s , this is just , you know , not a flood , not a dro ##ught , kind of an average day , it looks something like this .
let ' s put it that way .
and yet , we don ' t talk about it very much .
the green areas here show where corn yield ##s , just showing corn as an example , are already really high , probably the maximum you could find on earth today for that climate and soil , but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where we ' re only getting maybe 20 or 30 percent of the yield you should be able to get .
we need to face ' the other inc ##on ##veni ##ent truth . ' a global crisis in agriculture .
and there ' s nothing we do that is more crucial to our survival .
and i thought she ' d say , " oh , you know , up the lagoon somewhere , or maybe across africa , " but you ' ll be happy to know she said it came from here , it comes from the north sea .
so it ' s vast . but it should come with an as ##teris ##k , and the as ##teris ##k is that it ex ##clu ##des two third ##s of the workers of the world .
they ' re going to eddy in lagos .
first , it would be to understand that it could be considered a cooperative , and this is a thought from the brazilian legal scholar roberto manga ##bei ##ra unge ##r .
there are also some children who are born without arms , called cong ##eni ##tal lim ##b def ##icie ##ncy .
there are several available on the market , and here you see a few .
imagine , with somebody who ' s lost their whole arm , we still have four major nerve ##s that go down your arm .
and i challenge any ##body in the room to make their chest go like this .
you see him with his original device on the left there after eight months of use , and on the right , it is two months .
i could work them just by my thoughts .
ak : so i have the el ##bow that goes up and down .
here ' s amanda using an arm made by dek ##a research corporation .
but look at all the electro ##des around it .
todd kui ##ken : a prost ##hetic arm that " feels "
also , research within the continent is a lot easier to conduct due to widespread poverty , endemic diseases and ina ##de ##quate health care systems .
public account ##ability needs to be promoted through trans ##pare ##ncy and independent review by nong ##over ##n ##mental and international organizations as appropriate .
now , there are around a thousand trucks and buses and cars there .
and , more important ##ly , they ' re well - dressed .
where it ' s blue and it ' s green , it means the water is really cold .
and so we have this penguin project . the wildlife conservation society has funded me along with a lot of individuals over the last 27 years to be able to produce these kinds of maps .
because we ' ve solve ##d the problem in chu ##but province , which is like a state in argentina where punta tomb ##o is - - so that ' s about 1 , 000 kilometers of coast ##line - - but we haven ' t solve ##d the problem in northern argentina , uruguay and brazil .
turbo ' s never been fed .
here ' s a female that ' s in a hur ##ry . she ' s got food .
for them , nations , countries , boundaries , borders still matter a great deal , and often violent ##ly .
as you can see on this map , russia is still the largest country in the world .
they set up their own baza ##ars and medical clinic ##s .
specifically , it targets japan and korea and australia , countries that are strong allies of the united states .
so what can we do to think about borders different ##ly in this part of the world ?
what might ? i believe that what might solve the problem is infrastructure .
and i assure you it ' s every bit as important to them as it might have been to colon ##izer ##s and imperial ##ists .
in 2004 , 15 new countries joined the e . u .
the post - colonial entro ##py that is happen ##ing around the world is acc ##eler ##ating , and i ex ##pect more such changes to occur in the map as the states fragment .
many people think the lines on the map no longer matter , but para ##g khan ##na says they do . using maps of the past and present , he explains the root causes of border conflicts worldwide and proposes simple yet cun ##ning solutions for each .
and next you ' re going to see the long - lived mutant when it ' s young .
that ' s what it ' s like . and you would never know .
now you ' ve all heard of at least ins ##ulin .
so it ' s really interesting , and it makes sense in a way , that they ' re still young , so why would they be getting diseases of ag ##ing until their old ?
that ' s how it works . that ' s why we don ' t see the long life ##sp ##an , until we have the da ##f - 2 mutant .
and that ' s the case all over the world , as you can see from these stars .
although you ' re looking for a drug that can solve ag ##ing in old men like me , what you could do now pretty well in the lab , if you were allowed ethical ##ly , is start a human life from scratch with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer ?
if you look at birds , which live a long time , cells from the birds tend to be more resistant to a lot of different environmental stress ##es like high temperature or hydrogen pero ##xide , things like that .
as you can see , it ' s impossible to read .
here ' s another good article about a new campaign opposing privat ##ization of transit without any contact information for the campaign .
which leads us to the last one , which is our elections .
i can see i ' ve got my work cut out for me here .
now to begin to overcome our ign ##oran ##ce of the role of brain chemistry in brain circuit ##ry , it ' s help ##ful to work on what we biologi ##sts call " model organisms , " animals like fruit flies and laboratory mice , in which we can apply powerful genetic techniques to molecular ##ly identify and pin ##point specific classes of neu ##rons , as you heard about in allan jones ' s talk this morning .
valence means good or bad , positive or negative .
you can train a fly to avoid an od ##or , shown here in blue , if you pair that od ##or with a shock .
modern psychiatric drugs treat the chemistry of the whole brain , but neu ##ro ##bio ##logist david anderson believes in a more nua ##nce ##d view of how the brain functions . he ill ##umi ##nate ##s new research that could lead to targeted psychiatric medica ##tions - - that work better and avoid side effects . how ' s he doing it ? for a start , by making a bun ##ch of fruit flies angry .
so we set up an experiment where ##by we put a naked volunteer in a large cage , and in that cage we released mosquito ##s to see where they were biti ##ng on the body of that person .
so the problem that we face with this is that , throughout the landscape , all these pools of water with the larvae , they are scattered all over the place , which makes it very hard for an inspector like this to actually find all these breeding sites and treat them with insect ##ici ##des .
here we go .
but not all patients on the trans ##plant wait list are so fortuna ##te .
and in my mind , i realized as a surgical pioneer that the purpose of my position of influence was sure ##ly to speak up for those who have no influence .
and so gu ##ess what , scientists around the world and in the labs are racing to convert ag ##ing adult cells - - ag ##ing adult cells from you and me - - they are racing to rep ##rog ##ram these cells back into more useful ip ##s cells .
stem cells may be used to deliver growth factors to repair damaged heart muscle or be differenti ##ated into heart muscle cells to restore heart function .
and here are the results of this wonderful project that is the system in venezuela .
so what ' s going on when it doesn ' t ?
but here ' s what ' s going on here .
yeah .
and for the good of your relationships , i would encourage you to do the same .
but we don ' t know where , since we don ' t know how to read the pattern .
first , it ' s clearly a non - in ##vasi ##ve , wireless form of communication .
you ' re familiar with these cells because they are the ones that fru ##strat ##e you when you try to sw ##at the fly .
whenever a fly reaches the mid ##point of the chamber where the two od ##or streams meet , it has to make a decision .
whenever it comes up to the mid ##point , it pause ##s , it care ##fully sc ##ans the od ##or interface as if it was sn ##iff ##ing out its environment , and then it turns around .
the other piece of good news , for a scientist at least , is that much remains to be discovered .
and it ' s dependent on passive patients who just take it and don ' t ask any questions .
thomas batu ##ik : hi there , eric .
and you just saw a little bit of the first two with my interaction with dr . bati ##uk .
i had my own heart scar ##e years ago in graduate school , when we ' re under treatment for the kid ##ney , and suddenly , they ' re like , " oh , we think you have a heart problem . "
these population studies that we ' ve done have created tons of miracle drugs that have saved millions of lives , but the problem is that health care is treat ##ing us as average ##s , not unique individuals , because at the end of the day , the patient is not the same thing as the population who are studied . that ' s what ' s leading to the gu ##ess ##work .
so " thank you " feel likes a really tri ##te word , but thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving my life .
that ' s kell ##ar autumn , my former ph . d . student , professor now at lewis and clark , literally giving his first - born child up for this test .
oh . one thing i want to point out is , look at stick ##y ##bot .
and when i went back to research this , i realized that one of the great ted moments in the past , from nathan , we ' ve talk ##ed about an active tail .
for those of you who remember your physics , that ' s a zero - angular - momentum right ##ing response . but it ' s like a cat .
so we can mane ##uve ##r this way .
but then as it gets closer to the tree , look at the close - up . and see if you can see it land .
so i will spend a little time at the end .
well , the problem is that we ' ve got very complicated forces in the climate system .
this was - - this is south of the antarctic circle .
it took about 10 years to put this project together .
we ' ve actually changed the temperature in the last century just the right amount .
and it been growing for about 600 years .
the coral can take us back hundreds and thousands of years .
so i ' ll close with a short discussion of ocean acid ##ification .
now , what that means is that all of the organisms that live in the sea have evolved in this chem ##osta ##tted ocean , that ' s the reason that they ' re not able to respond or ada ##pt to this rapid acid ##ification that ' s going on right now .
the idea goes like this : imagine space is a sub ##strat ##e of all there is .
he said , if i want to describe one more force , maybe i need one more dimension .
some of you guys will fix that one day , but anything that ' s not flat on a screen is a new dimension , goes smaller , smaller , smaller , and way down in the micro ##sco ##pic depth ##s of space itself , this is the idea , you could have additional cur ##led up dimensions - - here is a little shape of a circle - - so small that we don ' t see them .
this something else is this dancing fila ##ment of energy .
and that question is this : when we look around the world , as scientists have done for the last hundred years , there appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe .
and if you watch these little fellows vi ##bra ##ting around - - they ' ll be there in a second - - right there , notice that they way they vi ##brate is affected by the geometry of the extra dimensions .
and now string theory comes along and says , yes , gravity , quantum mechanics , electro ##ma ##gnet ##ism , all together in one package , but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see .
what i want to talk about is not that context is everything , but why is context everything .
the one on the left comes from an orange surface , under direct light , facing to the right , viewed through a sort of a blu ##ish medium .
so , if i could have the lights down up here .
but i ' m not going to change anything within those boxes , except their meaning .
move your eyes around , bli ##nk , maybe close one eye .
and they land on the flower . they stick their tongue in there , called a pro ##bos ##cis , and they drink sugar water .
and you ' ll see there is a line , a fai ##nt line going across that image .
so , now , what i want to do : i ' m going to put the middle nine surfaces here under yellow ill ##umi ##nation by simply putting a filter behind them .
so if you look at security from economic terms , it ' s a trade - off .
and i think that ' s a fundamental ##ly interesting question .
so you can imagine how that works .
there ' s no real word for stuff that makes us secure , but doesn ' t make us feel secure .
i have feeling and reality .
i was born in new york city .
int ##uit ##ive is just another word for familiar .
an example , a great example , is the risk of smoking .
strong feelings can create a model .
i mean really though , information seems like our best hope .
i said , " well , that ' s kind of nea ##t .
couldn ' t do it . could not wait .
and let me show you what happened .
joachim de posada : don ' t eat the marsh ##mal ##low !
this was after 9 / 11 ; the city was in tough times .
and we ' ve already started construction on section two .
let me show you a slide here which ill ##ust ##rates the character of conflicts since 1946 until today .
and my country relie ##s on its security through military alliance , that ' s clear .
my point is that you don ' t have to be neutral to talk .
i think that is wrong .
so what can we learn from all of this ?
it ' s crucial to understand , i believe , because of technology and because of global ##ization , societies from bottom - up .
i said , " no , it ' s - - it ' s penguin shi ##t . "
and recently , i was in easter island , which is an inc ##redi ##bly beautiful place , and an inc ##redi ##bly mysterious place , because no matter where you go in easter island , you ' re struck by these statues , called the mo ##ai .
how long have they been standing in what positions ?
so , this device here is an in ##visi ##bility cl ##oak .
this subjects food to a force about 50 , 000 times that of normal gravity , and oh boy , does it clar ##ify chicken stock .
i mean , can you imagine ? e . t . ' s pho ##ning home , and i ' m not , like , there ? you know , hor ##rib ##le !
now , this is what ty ##ranno ##saurus rex looks like in my living room .
so , there ' s more and more activity near the boat , and all of a sudden somebody sho ##uts , " what ' s that in the water ? "
having explained those , that will set up for what i think will be a different idea about how to go about treat ##ing cancer .
so what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an asian person and a european person by looking at their ingredients list .
but sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that .
i mean , i see patients dying every day because we don ' t know what ' s going on inside of them .
so this is the signature out of which we ' re trying to get patterns .
the problem is that , in cancer , there isn ' t something else that ' s inside of you .
so your house is dealing with lea ##ks all the time , but it ' s fix ##ing them . it ' s drain ##ing them out and so on .
so thank you very much .
february 4th , we posted it on our website . this was before super tuesday .
stage one is a group where people systematic ##ally sever relationships from functional tribes , and then pool together with people who think like they do .
if that ' s how you talk ##ed , imagine what kind of work would get done .
here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation .
there is , in fact , another stage .

and it ' s too cerebral to anima ##te gut ##s and hearts and behavior when the going gets rough .
and in that light , for the religious , comp ##ass ##ion also brings us into the territory of mystery - - en ##cou ##rag ##ing us not just to see beauty , but perhaps also to look for the face of god in the moment of suffering , in the face of a stranger , in the face of the vi ##bran ##t religious other .
jean van ##ier says that his work , like the work of other people - - his great , belo ##ved , late friend mother teresa - - is never in the first instance about changing the world ; it ' s in the first instance about changing ours ##el ##ves .

and this turns out to have a special power all its own , because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm , not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at ; they were there because they had no choice , because they were driven to do what they thought was right .
this is no surprise though if you look at the insight ##s of contemporary psychology .
and they feature as their role models really great sales ##men .
and even away from the podium , when you called him to say hello , he would often end the conversation prema ##ture ##ly for fear that he was taking up too much of your time .
this is especially important for ex ##tro ##verte ##d children too .
and then i ' ll come back to the beginning , and tell you a little bit more - - hope ##fully convince you - - that i believe that in today ' s world , it is really important for business leaders not only to have an idea of what their business is all about , but to have a passion for something that is meaning ##ful .
so , one of our passion ##s in our company , and now one of my personal passion ##s , is to be able to really work hard at making the technology useful , accessible and af ##ford ##able .
as a matter of fact , we think reaching 100 percent is very doa ##ble , even before the 2015 time ##fra ##me . in other parts of emerging countries , such as india and china , the progress has been good - - has been solid , has been good . but in places that are not as developed , places like africa , latin america and other places in the world , the progress has been rather slow . as a matter of fact , i was just recently visiting south africa .
what i mean by that is that in some parts of the world , the government plays a key role in the development of technology .
one example of this has been the one lap ##top per child .
you have to be a better husband than i was , because that ' s how you make progress . " and now he began to make sense .
i meet a lot of people who are very smart , and say , " but why can ' t i figure out my problems ? "
i started it with one other family in 1980 .
and i asked this guy , i said , " well , do you believe that human beings are responsible to make the world a little bit better place for the next generation ?

and i don ' t mean that they drop out of school in the third or fourth grade - - they don ' t go .
her mother had not gone to primary school .
and somewhere in the middle of south dakota , i turn to my friend and i ask her a question that ' s been both ##ering me for 2 , 000 miles .
and finally , i want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single greatest moral , intellectual and creative leap you can make .
but there ' s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well - - and this one is cultural .
well the wrong side of her body is in banda ##ges because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one .
the miracle of your mind isn ' t that you can see the world as it is .
when it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
and to me , if you really want to red ##is ##cover wonder , you need to step outside of that tiny , ter ##rif ##ied space of right ##ness and look around at each other and look out at the vast ##ness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say , " wow , i don ' t know .
one of the iron ##ies of this whole system is we ' re discuss ##ing what to do about a system that we don ' t understand . we don ' t even know what oil is . we don ' t know where oil comes from . i mean , literally , it ' s still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes from . the best ass ##umption , and one of the best gu ##esse ##s in this stuff , is that this stuff comes out of this stuff , that these things abs ##or ##b sun ##light , rot under pressure for millions of years , and you get these black rivers .
what is this ? this is the first trans ##plant of naked dna , where you take an entire dna operating system out of one cell , ins ##ert it into a different cell , and have that cell boot up as a separate species . that ' s one month old . you will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff .
i happened to buy that mot ##el about three months after vivian started working there .
but given my be ##fu ##ddle ##d state of mind , i ended up in the self - help section very quickly .
they didn ' t even see the int ##ang ##ible stuff higher up the pyramid .
so as i spent time with leaders in the g ##nh movement , i got to really understand what they ' re doing .
actually , in fact , if you look in the dictionary , many di ##ction ##aries define pursuit as to " chase with host ##ility . "
we ' re asking 10 simple questions - - it is sim ##plici ##ty .
in fact , as leaders , what we need to learn is that we can influence the quality of that unit of production by creating the conditions for our employees to live their calling .
bl : all right . one , two , three .
right ? if you go down below on a boat , your inner ear ##s are you telling you you ' re moving . your eyes , because it ' s moving in register with the boat , say i ' m standing still .
now here , i want to share the stage with someone quite special . right ?
bl : " can you help me , henry ? " what good scientist says that , right ?
so we asked larry and natalie hem ##pel to write a commentary situat ##ing the findings for scientists , right , putting in the references , and we sub ##mit it to biology letters .

so what happens to all these to ##xin ##s when we die ?

thank you .
we followed my job , and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldn ' t do .
they ' re exotic . they ' re experimental .
so what do we make of all of this ?
it ' s so clear , yet they ' re in den ##ial . "
hos ##pice was for people who were dying , and terence wasn ' t dying .
it ' s part of our dna as humans , and maybe it ' s time our healthcare system - - doctors , patients , insurance companies , us , started accounting for the power of that hope .
well , we collect data from satellites , from airplane ##s , from ground vehicles , from people .
this process is a very calculated process .
microsoft ' s stephen law ##ler gives a w ##hir ##l ##wind tour of virtual earth , moving up , down and through its hyper - real city ##sca ##pes with da ##zz ##ling ##ly fluid ##ity , a remarkable feat that requires sta ##gger ##ing amounts of data to bring into focus .

i ' ve been spending a lot of time thinking about coffee ##house ##s for the last five years , because i ' ve been kind of on this quest to investigate this question of where good ideas come from .
and what they notice ##d was they don ' t have a lot of d ##vr ##s , they don ' t have a lot of micro ##wave ##s , but they seem to do a pretty good job of keeping their cars on the road .
this is what your office should look like , is part of my message here .
and darwin kept these cop ##ious note ##books where he wrote down every little idea he had , every little hun ##ch .
and so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues , and everybody ' s like , " no , i had ##n ' t thought of doing that .
could you go the other way ?
this shift is the most striking in the u . s . and in the u . k . , but it ' s a global phenomenon .

the small idea is , let ' s all of us engage more with this in the way that jason has illustrated .

my family was on a road trip and we were in the grand canyon .
and this is really what i want to talk to you about today - - about cancer .
so , this really changed my view of looking at cancer .
tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels .
so , is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the sk ##elet ##al muscle tissue , but once in contact inside the sk ##elet ##al muscle tissue , my ##od acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become sk ##elet ##al muscle cells ?
and the grandmother had never let any western ##ers ever see her .
and remember this picture , because i ' m going to show you another picture later , but you can see how much she looks like her grandmother , although she looks so western .
and i said , " i ' m 28 years old , and i live in hotels , and i ' m not married . "
so , i went back to korea , and i went back to hyun - soo ##k ' s village , and she was gone .
and the more i tried talking to him , the less friendly he was getting .
i just think that - - what little i know about the situation , she has very little chance here of having the kind of life that you probably would like her to have . "
and he said , " the second day she was here she made up a list of all of the names of the older kids and the younger kids .
and the third night , we came back , we ' d just gone out to dinner , where you saw the pictures , and we got to the front desk and the guy at the front desk said , " there ' s no other free rooms on your floor tonight , so if you want to put the kids five floors below you , there ' s a room there . "
and the whole room filled with smoke in about two seconds .
and i remember , natasha didn ' t want us opening the door - - sorry , i was trying not to open the door , because we ' d spent so much time barri ##cadi ##ng the room .
this is a tri - star , and so they let natasha actually sit in the jump seat .
gene even did a little til ##e work in the kitchen , which was that , " once upon a time , there was a beautiful girl that came from hills of korea to live hap ##pil ##y ever after in atlanta . "
thank you all of you .
a lot has happened in the last few years , and let ' s start with the planets .
in fact , even back during the ancient ##s , the solar system in that sense would look on a diagram like this .
most of these are candidates .
so the question is : is that chemical phenomenon universal , or is it something which depends on the planet ?
this understanding of chemistry actually can help us with our daily lives .
can you imagine how small it is ?
let ' s start this new revolution at the tail end of the old one , with synthetic biology being the way to transform both our environment and our future .
then , uganda started to turn back , whereas zimbabwe sky ##rock ##ete ##d , and some years later south africa had a terrible rise of hiv frequency .
not the drug in itself , but the treatment and the care which is needed around it .
there ' s a lot of things that we thought , that now , good research , done by african institutions and researchers together with the international researchers , show that that ' s not the case .
una ##ids have done good data available , finally , about the spread of hiv .
hans roslin ##g un ##vei ##ls new data visual ##s that un ##tang ##le the complex risk factors of one of the world ' s dead ##lies ##t diseases : hiv . he argues that preventing transmission ##s - - not drug treatment ##s - - is the key to ending the epi ##dem ##ic .
it ' s based on pur ##chas ##ing power parit ##y .
we know that ' s wrong , because we conducted two great natural experiments in the 20th century to see if geography matter ##ed more than institutions .
let ' s call them the killer apps .
meanwhile , there ' s no scientific revolution anywhere else .
that ' s the consumer society , and it prop ##els economic growth more than even technological change itself .
any society can adopt these institutions , and when they do , they achieve what the west achieved after 1500 - - only faster .
that ' s so true .
and that ' s all we seem to be car ##ing about recently .
so what this figure shows is that spiders date back to almost 380 million years .
these can be groupe ##d into seven categories .
so i ' ve colored in the gl ##yc ##ines again in green , alan ##ine in red , and the seri ##nes , the letter s , in purple . and you can see that the top repeat unit can be explained almost entirely by green and red , and the bottom repeat unit has a substantial amount of purple .
what you see here on this tough ##ness graph is the higher the black dot is on the graph , the higher the tough ##ness .
to bor ##row from the writings of a spider named charlotte , silk is ter ##rif ##ic .
fl ##ick ##r is a photo - sharing service that allows people to take photos , up ##load them , share them over the web and so forth .
you notice we haven ' t got everybody who has a photo .
and worst of all , that figure at the bottom , approximately ten photos per photographer , is a lie .
this is the math underlying the 80 / 20 rule . right ?
right ? so , when institutions are told they are obstacles , and that there are other ways of co ##ord ##inat ##ing the value , they go through something a little bit like the ku ##bler - ross stages - - - - of reaction , being told you have a fatal illness : den ##ial , anger , bar ##gai ##ning , acceptance .
the inventor ##s don ' t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states right now ty ##ing themselves into knots , trying to figure out whether or not blog ##gers are journalists .
it was produced by anal ##y ##zing their communications patterns using a lot of these tools . and doubt ##less the intelligence communities of the world are doing the same work today for the attacks of last week .
so a baker , and a good baker , knows how to pull or draw forth the in ##herent sugar trapped in the star ##ch .
that ' s the challenge . oka ##y , so , now , what we - - in the journey of wheat , let ' s go back and look at these 12 stages .
this takes a second , but it ' s a distinctive stage .
and then we have stage 12 , which the text ##books call " pack ##aging , " but my students call " eating . "
it ' s not only been killed , but it ' s been denied any potential for creating future life .
bacteria is in there , eating the same sugar ##s , turning them into acids .
it ' s used as a symbol for transformation .
and i ' m not kidd ##ing , i just think we should just say that and move forward .
they ' re all mounted on my instruments .
it ' s a bun ##ch of crazy pic ##tog ##raphic notation .
let ' s watch just another clip .
i ' ve decided , ultimately , that this is the wrong question , that this is not the important question .
so half the time , she acted as if she like ##d the crack ##ers and didn ' t like the bro ##cco ##li - - just like a baby and any other san ##e person .
if we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us prima ##tes , but also including other mammals , birds , even mars ##upi ##als like kang ##aro ##os and wo ##mba ##ts , it turns out that there ' s a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brain ##s are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are .
and at least until they ' re 23 , we ' re still pop ##ping those worms into those little open mouth ##s .
then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth .
the first one is , again , remember , these are four year - old ##s .
oh .
and we even know something about the way the brain does this .
alison gop ##nik : what do bab ##ies think ?
now , the only way to get around that is to actually sim ##ulate the human body and to sim ##ulate that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body .
those are then selected by the algorithm , rep ##rod ##uce ##d with mutation and rec ##omb ##ination ##s to introduce sex as well .
now , this might look kind of tri ##via ##l , but it ' s actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds .
and then , finally hits the floor .
so , they wanted to have a digital version of a stu ##nt ##man and that ' s what we ' ve been working on for the past few months .
at the moment , doing something like this by hand would take you probably a couple of days .
there ' s so many things we can do with this right now .
we do have one uni ##nten ##tional dancer actually , the last thing i ' m going to show you .
it ' s a children ' s book for the ipad .
i remember we cried prof ##usel ##y when the little goat ##s we played with in the summer became biri ##ani .
and my argument [ is ] that the only way for us to teach creat ##ivity is by teaching children perspectives at the earliest stage .
and you ' ll get paid for it . you can think about it , if you want .
which they do .
let ' s create a word processor that ' s just a word processor .
there are these " wizards " every ##w ##here .
palm is also , especially in the old days , wonderful about this .
i write the code that fit ##s the world today .
i made a fortune over at pi ##xar .
in my very last example - - i do a lot of my work using speech recognition software , and you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous .
dp : thank you very much .
and the danger is that they can cause roughly what ' s a pan ##dem ##ic .
and i would say that we can ' t give up the rule of law to fight an as ##ym ##metric threat , which is what we seem to be doing because of the present , the people that are in power , because that ' s to give up the thing that makes civilization .
we ' ll hear a lot more about that from al gore very shortly .
it ' s a strange place inside a nano ##tub ##e .
we need new anti - viral ##s and coc ##kta ##ils . we need new kinds of va ##cci ##nes .
and finally , i think we have to do something that ' s not really - - it ' s almost una ##cce ##pta ##ble to say this - - which , we have to begin to design the future .
i think it ' s time that we transition ##ed to a solar system - going civilization and species .
how hard is it going to be to find life on mars ?
i think it ' s there , and i think we need to go look for it , and i think it ' s underground .
it ' s a very simple trick , and i never fail to do it when i ' m sitting in a window seat .
in this cave , great areas are covered by this red ##dish material that you see here , and also these eno ##rm ##ous crystal ##s of sele ##nite that you can see dang ##ling down .
in order to access these sub - surface environments that we ' re interested in , we ' re very interested in developing the tools to do this .
so , we ' re talking about things like inf ##lata ##ble liner ##s that can conform to the complex topo ##logical shape on the inside of a cave , fo ##ame ##d - in - place air ##lock ##s to deal with this complex topo ##logy , various ways of getting breath ##ing gases made from the intr ##ins ##ic materials of these bodies .
but when you tell someone your goal and they ac ##k ##now ##led ##ge it , psycho ##logist ##s have found that it ' s called a " social reality . "
and so it is with archi ##medes , the great greek math ##ema ##tician .
forge ##ries were painted over it , and it suffered very badly from mol ##d .
and so before we could start imaging archi ##medes , we had to take this book apart .
and that ' s what it looks like .
but as the electrons go round at the speed of light , they shed x - rays .
this was a bad idea , because philip of mac ##edo ##n had a son called alexander the great , and they lost the battle of cha ##eron ##ea .
because institutions at the moment confine their data with copyright restrictions and that sort of thing .
how do you read a two - thousand - year - old manuscript that has been eras ##ed , cut up , written on and painted over ? with a powerful particle acc ##eler ##ator , of course ! ancient books curator william noel tells the fas ##cina ##ting story behind the archi ##medes pali ##mps ##est , a byzantine prayer book containing previously - unknown original writings from ancient greek math ##ema ##tician archi ##medes and others .
there are very few places in the u . s . where you can try real kobe , and one of them is wolfgang pu ##ck ' s restaurant , cut , in los angeles .
they did give me a tour , though .
i did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oil ##s .
and to try this - - i couldn ' t get a loan ##er , but i did go into the manhattan show ##room of the manufacturer , toto , and they have a bath ##room off of the show ##room that you can use , which i used .
most of the cars that i drive , if i get up to 80 they start to ratt ##le .
it was three days , four mea ##ls .
and in particular , i think we can learn things about learning .
it ' s from the game world of warcraft with more than 10 million players global ##ly , one of whom is me , another of whom is my wife .
now , if you take a game like warcraft , you can think about it , if you like , as a great box - opening effort .
no , we want one or two monsters on the screen at any one time .
second , multiple long and short - term aims - - 5 , 000 pies , bor ##ing , 15 pies , interesting .
and what this means is we can pred ##ic ##t learning , we can pred ##ic ##t enhanced engagement , these windows , these windows of time , in which the learning is taking place at an enhanced level .
let ' s start with business .
and through this work , i hope to better understand the evolutionary vu ##lne ##rab ##ili ##ties of our bodies , so that we can improve and better manage our health in the future .
and so previous studies had only focused on micro ##sco ##py .
so i took a job at the united nations world food programme as a way to try to address these security issues through food security issues .
unfortunately , obe ##sity ' s not only an american problem .
there ' s this large , consolidated farming that ' s led to what we eat in america , and it ' s really been since around 1980 , after the oil crisis , when , you know , mass con ##sol ##idat ##ion , mass exodus of small farmers in this country .
the icon ##s like michael poll ##an and jamie oliver in his ted prize wish both addressed this last three - decade time period as inc ##redi ##bly relevant for food system change .
this is a construction helm ##et that i received two years ago at the ground ##break ##ing of the largest project i , and my firm , have ever been involved in .
but i ' m going to reduce this to the beginning of the process , into three very pe ##dant ##ic statements .
if we are so good at our craft should ##n ' t we be able to con ##cei ##ve of an architectural manifestation that slide ##s sea ##ml ##ess ##ly through the project ' s and the client ' s con ##stra ##ints ?
the architectural manifestation was frank ##ly just dum ##b .
you ' re going down into our lobby , go through the lobby with our own little dang ##ly bits , whether you like them or not , up through the sta ##ir that leads you into the auditorium .
and the solution in terms of the bal ##con ##ies was to use something that we all know as a score ##board lift .
this building has the ability , in short order , to go back to a flat floor organization such that they can rent it out .
and to remi ##nd you that here is an example in which architecture actually did something .
and i really loved this idea of the partial gli ##mps ##e into somebody ' s life .
" i love how they were able to preserve most in everything that makes you feel close to nature - - butterflies , man - made forests , limestone caves and hey , even a huge python . "
so these are some newer projects that actually aren ' t even launched publicly yet .
we ' re very used to this .

it meant that there could be extreme dynamics , which there were ##n ' t in some of these other kinds of music .

now as i was training in clinical medicine and hem ##ato ##logy and on ##cology and stem cell trans ##plant ##ation , what we had instead , cas ##cadi ##ng through the regulatory network at the fda , were these substances - - ars ##enic , tha ##lido ##mide and this chemical deriva ##tive of nitrogen musta ##rd gas .
in effect , the cancer cell was forget ##ting it was cancer and becoming a normal cell .
and this was , unfortunately , successful .
the first is if anything is unique about this research , it ' s less the science than the strategy - - that this for us was a social experiment , an experiment in what would happen if we were as open and hon ##est at the earliest phase of discovery chemistry research as we could be .
one thing you can do with a picture like this is simply ad ##mire it .
because if there had been , they would have collapsed under the gravi ##tation ##al pull into a huge black hole .
that ' s our job as cos ##mol ##ogist ##s .
and this energy , according to einstein , ex ##ert ##s a push on the universe .
that implica ##tion was studied by bolt ##zmann back in the 19th century .
that ' s the region where entro ##py is low .
but we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more .
or maybe the big bang is not the beginning of the universe .
i had never seen an internet .
i felt very happy to be at the secondary school , so i was determined to do anything possible to receive education .
god ble ##ss .
so , here , whatever movement i do in my physical world is actually replica ##ted inside the digital world just using this small device that i made , around eight years back , in 2000 .
i took it very literally , and took my bike helm ##et , put a little cut over there so that the project ##or actually fit ##s nice ##ly .
the camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements , but , interesting ##ly , is also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand .

if you don ' t have open spaces , you ' ve got to go there and open spaces .
you can build nice stations .
the first one is , you can change from what i call a [ vic ##ious ] circle to a virtual circle .
you can imagine how people get happy with me watching these kinds of scenes .

i was leaving a seminar when it started , hum ##ming to myself , fu ##mb ##ling with my bag just as i ' d done a hundred times before , when suddenly i heard a voice cal ##ml ##y observe , " she is leaving the room . "
it was at this point that events began to rapidly over ##take me .
i used to say that these people saved me , but what i now know is they did something even more important in that they em ##power ##ed me to save myself , and crucial ##ly , they helped me to understand something which i ' d always suspected : that my voices were a meaning ##ful response to trauma ##tic life events , particularly childhood events , and as such were not my enemies but a source of insight into sol ##vable emotional problems .
to para ##ph ##rase chavez , once social change begins , it cannot be reverse ##d .
what they remember is , of course , the great triumph , that the brits were beaten , and we won , and that the country was born .
and that makes it extra ##ord ##inar ##ily interesting as a place to explore .
but better - - what is more important is that they would have to con ##centra ##te sun ##light .
you see the red gl ##ow in their eyes , which is the reflection of the flash ##light .
they look like , maybe like sun ##fl ##ower ##s .
i was a teenager , and at 15 or 16 , i gu ##ess like all teenager ##s , we want to just do what we love and what we believe in .
and that allows me to check my timer discrete ##ly , here , without bend ##ing my el ##bow .
i mean , think about it : the care we take in select ##ing sung ##lasse ##s , or jewel ##ry , or accesso ##ries is really important , so if it isn ' t beautiful , it really doesn ' t belong on your face .
so we called it y water . and so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room : the three - dimensional design , the ideas , the brand ##ing , it all becomes deeply connected .
in fact , you can see each logo is a little bit different .
and if any ##body asks why you ' re carrying a con ##dom , you can just say you like the design .
the first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage .
and what , if anything , do men have to do with it ?
my father , who had fought in three wars , could not save his own sister from this suffering .
" he was flat ##tere ##d .
i see traditional music like a kind of rebellion , in which people can really speak their voice , especially traditional songs from other parts of the former yugoslav republic .
but no , for the protest , they dressed all in white , no makeup .
women like saken ##a and lea ##h and lay ##ma have hum ##ble ##d me and changed me and made me reali ##ze that i should not be so quick to jump to ass ##umption ##s of any kind .
we can demi ##lita ##riz ##e societies and pour resources , instead , into reservoir ##s of gen ##uine security .
and i thought , " well , sir , i am not a str ##ategi ##st , nor am i specialist . i am merely a story ##teller . "
so what could this mean ?
they were together while pra ##ying .
and there are two important messages , or two lessons , to take from that reality .
and the religious police impose ##s the supposed islamic way of life on every citizen , by force - - like women are forced to cover their heads - - wear the hija ##b , the islamic head cover .
it ' s our faith , and we will be loyal to it .
and this is a question , i think , which needs to be discussed care ##fully .
that ' s an experience that not every other muslim nation in the middle east had until very recently .
mustafa ak ##yol : faith versus tradition in islam
it clear ##s the forest , reveals the trees inside .
and anti ##body sta ##ining ##s like this one can be used to understand that sort of question .
darf ##ur may have slip ##ped from the news head ##lines , but the killing and dis ##placement there continues as well , and the she ##er human mise ##ry that it creates is very hard to fat ##hom .
thus , even though every civilian killed , mai ##med , rape ##d , or torture ##d is one too many , the fact that the number of civilian casualties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago , is good news .
but then , is northern ireland a unique example , or does this kind of explanation only hold more generally in democratic and developed countries ?
both success ##es and failure ##s teach us several critically important things that we need to bear in mind if we want the good news to continue .
as a photographer for national geographic , i ' ve portrayed it for many .
mud and minerals become sub ##strat ##e ; there are bacteria .
on land , life turned a corner . ja ##ws formed first ; teeth came later .
extinction can come slowly , but sometimes it arrives fast .
and where it doesn ' t , as in greenland in winter , mars is still not very far .
so in australia , " mo " is sla ##ng for musta ##che , so we renamed the month of november " move ##mber " and created some pretty basic rules , which still stand today .
and we pers ##isted , and we got 450 guys growing musta ##ches , and together we raised 54 , 000 dollars , and we donated every cent of that to the prost ##ate cancer foundation of australia , and that represented at the time the single biggest donation they ' d ever received .
so what we did was , we took some of the money that we raised in australia to bring the campaign across to this country , the u . s , and the u . k . , and we did that because we knew , if this was successful , we could raise infinite ##ly more money global ##ly than we could just in australia . and that money fuel ##s research , and that research will get us to a cure .
so we pile ##d into a taxi , and this is our taxi driver , and i was sitting in the back seat , and he turned around and said , " where are you going ? "
and so we said , right , we ' d rede ##fine ##d charity . we need to rede ##fine the way these guys operate . how do we do that ?
he could see what was happen ##ing to his forest , to his environment , because he was taken under his grandfather ' s wing when he was only two years old to begin to learn about the forest and the way of life of his people .
he would tell you , as he told me , " i asked myself , " he said , " what did my grand ##pare ##nts and my great - grand ##pare ##nts do to protect the forest for me ?
we have to change .
even that wasn ' t enough .
he would tell you , " i ' m a collector , and i cura ##te a museum . "
they have a sense of the great arc of time and their tiny place in it .
he went around once , he went around twice , he went around th ##rice .
on the banks of a river called the indus , now in pakistan .
you should not be sis ##yp ##hus , who rolls a rock up a mountain all day only to find the boulder rolle ##d down at night .
you see , the indians also had a river that separate ##s the land of the living from the land of the dead .
the denomina ##tor of the gym ##nos ##op ##his ##t ' s life was infinity .
there is no orchestra conductor .
and i would see the ex ##as ##pera ##tion between my american and european colleagues , when they were dealing with india .
so , there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life .
and so the next time you meet someone , a stranger , one request : understand that you live in the subject ##ive truth , and so does he .
you ' re afraid if you look for your passion and don ' t find it , you ' ll feel like you ' re an idi ##ot , so then you make ex ##cus ##es about why you ' re not going to look for your passion .
you know what ? here ' s a little secret .
you need 20 interests , and then one of them , one of them might grab you , one of them might engage you more than anything else , and then you may have found your greatest love in comparison to all the other things that interest you , and that ' s what passion is .
what do you want me to say ?
" look kid . i had a dream once , too , but - - but . "
and that ' s why you ' re not going to have a great career , unless - - unless , that most evo ##cati ##ve of all english words - - unless .
you may recall a year ago when a fires ##tor ##m eru ##pted after the united states prevent ##ive services task force reviewed the world ' s mam ##mo ##graphy screening literature and issued a guide ##line rec ##ommen ##ding against screening mam ##mo ##gram ##s in women in their 40 ##s .
so it ' s easy to see this tumor in the upper part of this fatt ##y breast .
and soon ##er or later , we ' re going to have to accept the fact that health care innovation can ' t always come at a much higher price .
so here we were , a nuclear phys ##ici ##st , an interni ##st , soon joined by carrie hr ##uska , a bio ##med ##ical engineer , and two radio ##logist ##s , and we were trying to take on the entre ##nche ##d world of mam ##mo ##graphy with a machine that was held together by duc ##t tape .
here ' s an example from that screening study .
we still need to complete the screening study using the low dose , and then our findings will need to be replica ##ted at other institutions , and this could take five or more years .
the bab ##ies that we were carrying when my patient first asked me this question are now both in middle school , and the answer has been so slow to come .
i can look at your financial records .
or should we respect his privacy , protect his dig ##nity and leave him alone ?
what ' s a moral operating system ?
i ' m just going back and forth ; i ' m not getting anywhere .
if you think that way , you have a platon ##ist moral framework .
not just because it rang earlier , but i ' m going to take it because i made a little calculation .
what ' s the formula ?
or like kant , did i use reason to figure out what was intr ##ins ##ically right ? "
dum ta da da dum dum ta da da dum well , your musician friend will stop you and say , " you know , the theme music for your data revolution , that ' s an opera , that ' s wagner .
it ' s our invisible reality .
and this noise is the most neutral .
definit ##ely not perfect . so you would probably shut it , at this point .
you have to know that today , roughly one or two every drug pil ##ls is not taken correct ##ly .
i designed it to help kids to follow the treatment .
so , huge tragedy .
because the roots of the plant are not very effective .
now we can eat local food .
so , if you believe the media accounts , being a drug dealer in the height of the crack coca ##ine epi ##dem ##ic was a very gl ##amo ##rous life , in the words of virginia post ##rel .
and in the words of malcolm glad ##well , crack coca ##ine was the extra - chun ##ky version of toma ##to sauce for the inner city .
he was really a cur ##ious sight to be seen .
went up to the floor , the second floor , and said : " hey , guys .
now , the group i really want you to think about , though , are the ones at the bottom , the foot soldiers .
we found in our gang - - and , admitted ##ly , this was not really sort of a standard situation ; this was a time of intense violence - - of a lot of gang wars - - as this gang actually became quite successful . but there were costs .
but what happened was , the rules changed , and they never got to make partner .
and the words of a gang member capture it quite nice ##ly .
from there i started with sky ##di ##ving .
2005 i did a base jump from the eige ##r , from the monk and from the jung ##frau , three very famous mountains in switzerland .
i know the answer to this , but how do you land ?
and do you ever say , " no , no i ' m not going to . "
i think there is a sociali ##zing dimension in , kind of , moving that border .
is art about that ?
so the movement with your legs will change the color of your horizon .
and " ha - ha , there is a picture and here is i . and what does it matter ? "
in the spec ##ta ##cular large - scale projects he ' s famous for , olaf ##ur elias ##son creates art from a pale ##tte of space , distance , color and light . this idea - pack ##ed talk begins with an experiment in the nature of perception .
i think that ' s got to be scar ##ing a lot of animals away .
we need a nasa - like organization for ocean exploration , because we need to be exploring and protecting our life support systems here on earth .
when she was 10 years old in 1927 , she published her first book of poems called " the jan ##itor ' s boy . "
and my blood fr ##oze when i read that because i had written the plain - song music 130 years after he ' d written the letter .
natalie merchant sings from her new album , & lt ; em & gt ; leave your sleep . & lt ; / em & gt ; lyrics from near - forgotten 19th - century poetry pair with her un ##mista ##kab ##le voice for a performance that brought the audience to its feet .
they are very different from us in body form .
so as an adult , when i started to read about the amazing breakthrough ##s with penny patterson and koko , with sue savage - rum ##bau ##gh and kan ##zi , pan ##bani ##sha , irene pepper ##berg , alex the par ##rot , i got all ex ##cite ##d .
this is what the internet looked like when it was born and you can call that the internet of middle - aged white men , mostly middle - aged white men .
joining me are three of our eight atlantic bottle ##nose dolphins : 20 - year - old che ##sa ##pea ##ke , who was our first dolphin born here , her four - year - old daughter bay ##ley , and her half sister , 11 - year - old maya .
that ' s a number only that congress can app ##rec ##iate .
what that means is that what we ' re learning with these interactions with other species will teach us , ultimately , how we might intera ##ct with an alien from another world .
all right , well thank you all so much for joining us .
and now people from iran are talking to me .
they have graphic designers . what ?
and this whole list of pages on facebook dedicated to the same message , to people sending their love , one to each other .
remember that image from the beginning ?
and i ' m just going to take a picture of it , and i ' m just going to post it on facebook with kind of " israeli ##s for peace " or something .
as you can see , a project evo ##lve ##s through a series of generations of design meetings .
but then we had a meeting with a chinese businessman who saw our design and said , " wow , that ' s the chinese character for the word ' people . ' " so , apparently this is how you write " people , " as in the people ' s republic of china .
china symbol ##ized by the dragon .
you can try it .
if you do come to copenhagen , you will probably see an installation by ai wei ##wei , the chinese artist .
so if you go back into the parking , into the corridor ##s , it ' s almost like traveling into a parallel universe from cars and colors , into this sort of south - facing urban oasis .
and our main idea was to sort of sample the seven most significant mountains of the topography of azerbaijan and rein ##ter ##pre ##t them into urban and architectural structures , in ##hab ##ita ##ble of human life .
and i must say , before i go on , i should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because i ' m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that .
because we can ' t solve problems .
so what i ' m propos ##ing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situation when we ' ve had a menu of choice ##s .
and then you ask , why economist ##s ?
but it ' s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost .
the inc ##idence of malaria is about a couple of [ million ] people get infected every year .
so again , what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment , at first rate .
of course , that ' s mainly because climate change has good pictures .
the only two requirements were that they were studying at the university , and they spoke english .
over the past hundred years , the combination of liberal democracy and private capital ##ism has helped to cat ##ap ##ult the united states and western countries to new levels of economic development .
i put it to you today that it is this system that is em ##bod ##ied by china that is gathering momentum amongst people in the emerging markets as the system to follow , because they believe increasingly that it is the system that will promise the best and fastest improvements in living standards in the short ##est period of time .
i ' m here to also tell you that there are lots of shift ##s occurring around what china is doing in the democratic stan ##ce .
but i put it to you that if the united states and european countries want to remain global ##ly influential , they may have to consider cooper ##ating in the short term in order to compete , and by that , they might have to focus more aggressive ##ly on economic outcomes to help create the middle class and therefore be able to hold government account ##able and create the demo ##c ##rac ##ies that we really want .
in this vei ##n , we can increase economic growth .
that if you live in the best climate , in san diego in the united states , or in the shi ##tti ##est climate , in buffalo , new york , you are going to be just as happy in either place .
and so even if we make those very important decisions for very sil ##ly reasons , it remains statistical ##ly true that there are more georges living in georgia and there are more dennis ##es becoming dent ##ists and there are more paula ##s who are married to paul than statistical ##ly via ##ble .
and i of course knew stuff , as a designer , about typ ##ography , even though we worked with those animals not so successfully .

this boy is called messo ##ud .
we ' ve flow ##n the cassini spacecraft by this moon now several times , flying closer and deeper into these jets , into the dense ##r regions of these jets , so that now we have come away with some very precise composition ##al measurements .
we ' re always sort of small in the face of its ex ##pan ##se .
and that connection is an une ##qui ##vo ##cal ##ly physical process .
they looked for the un ##wi ##red places , and that ' s meant north and south , primarily these cables to africa .
thank you .
and this material that ' s de ##posit ##ed either starts as a liquid form or a material powder form .
the detail that you can get today is quite amazing .
but it ' s very hard to create that in standard ways .
you can just make it physically on the spot .
we ' re now , instead of shipping a product across the world , we ' re sending data across the internet .
businesses want different things .
but it wasn ' t just us . even in the muslim world , his definition of jih ##ad began to gain acceptance .
what does that mean for us in the west ?
but that ' s still not reason for us to dis ##eng ##age , because we ' ve seen that movie before , in afghanistan .
al ja ##zeera brought information to them , showed them what was being said and done in the name of their religion , exposed the hy ##po ##cris ##y of osam ##a bin laden and al qaeda , and allowed them , gave them the information that allowed them to come to their own conclusion ##s .
thank you .
i was struck immediately by the kind ##ness and the gent ##lene ##ss in her face , and i asked her to tell me her story .
she lives with all of that ins ##ecu ##rity , and in fact , in january , during the ethnic riot ##s , she was chase ##d from her home and had to find a new sha ##ck in which she would live .
i truly believe it ' s where dig ##nity starts .
by the way , the secret is not to go to sleep until you ' ve written your words for the day .
i had just taken trigo ##nome ##try in high school , i learned about the para ##bola and how it could con ##centra ##te rays of light to a single focus .
i ' m glad you heard earlier today , batteries are un ##beli ##eva ##bly energy - - lack of density compared to fuel .
you take a problem that you can ' t solve with a pure mathematical answer , you build an evolutionary system to try multiple tries at gu ##ess ##ing , you add sex - - where you take half of one solution and half of another and then make new mutations - - and you use natural selection to kill off not as good solutions .
so what you see here is 12 separate peta ##ls , that each could be controlled with individual micro ##pro ##cesso ##rs that would only cost a dollar .
so , once you have mobility , now you ' re making a lot of engines because you ' ve got lots of units , as opposed to steam ships or big factories where you ' re not making as many units , so this was the engine that ended up benefit ##ing from mass production where all the other engines didn ' t benefit .
you move that up and down with a little bit of energy but now you ' re only shift ##ing the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end , down to the hot end and up to the cold end .
so now you put the two things together .
so this is the first test where we took it outside and each of the peta ##ls were individual ##ly seeking .
it ' s just un ##beli ##eva ##ble what the potential is to take advantage of solar energy there , and i ' m really ex ##cite ##d to talk more about finding ways we can help with that .
bill gross : a solar energy system that tracks the sun
but still , we look at the pieces .
and out of that field campaign we ' ll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules .
and that was a good thing to help , you know , the cause .
so , good things come out of , you know , inc ##om ##pre ##hen ##sion - - - - which i will do a painting of , and then it will end up in my work .
i work for the new yorker , and i do covers , and 9 / 11 happened and it was , you know , a complete and ut ##ter end of the world as we knew it .

i received a box in the mail and it was wr ##apped with newspaper and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead .

we were hop ##ing that it was ##s going to have a kind of evil , spider ##y walk , but instead it created this pretty lam ##e way of moving forward .
katrina showed us that we cannot completely depend on government to have read ##iness in hand , to be capable of handling things .
for example , all mask ##s are made in china .
add on pan ##dem ##ic threat , you ' re in big trouble .
let ' s see , should we order that all pet ##s be kept indoor ##s ?
in the sars epi ##dem ##ic , we learned in hong kong that most of transmission was because people were removing their mask ##s imp ##rop ##erly .
every city , county , state did their own thing .
the institute of medicine study felt that you could not rec ##yc ##le mask ##s .

we ' ve never seen anything even remote ##ly like this before . "
it ' s really mane ##uve ##rable . you have a hand - held remote , so you can pretty easily control acceleration , brak ##ing , go in reverse if you like , also have brak ##ing .

i want you just for a second to experience this amazing human symphony .
and what i ' d like to do is take you up to the cano ##py , not by putting all of you into rope ##s and har ##ness ##es , but rather showing you a very short clip from a national geographic film called " heroes of the high frontier . "
we ' ve done strip ##ping experiments where we ' ve removed mats of epi ##ph ##yte ##s and looked at the rates of rec ##olo ##ni ##zation .
we consul ##t to the media about cano ##py questions ; we have a cano ##py newsletter ; we have an email lists ##er ##v .

i brought my scientific colleagues and sus ##tain ##ability prac ##titi ##oner ##s into the prison .
once upon a time , the world was a big , dy ##sf ##un ##ction ##al family .

they ' re watching all of us . they ' ve dug a basement , and they ' ve built a spy center to try and run algorithms and figure out which ones of us are troubles ##ome , and if any of us comp ##lain about that , we ' re arrested for terrorism .

over time , those gas molecules disso ##lve into your blood and tissue ##s and start to fill you up .

now , as we breath ##e , we produce carbon dio ##xide , and that carbon dio ##xide needs to be sc ##rub ##bed out of the system .
and i can talk about it all day - - just ask my wife - - but i want to move on to something that ' s kind of much more interesting .
we also see sharks , much more regularly than i would have expected to .
now , i don ' t know if any of you get u . s . news and world report - - i got the recent issue .
now , this one ' s pretty cool .
the reason i show this - - not to put a down ##er on everything - - but i just want to use it to key off my philosophy of life in general , which is that we all have two goals .
despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders origina ##tes in the brain , most of these disorders are dia ##gnosed solely on the basis of observa ##ble behavior .

now drake did not discover extra ##ter ##rest ##rial intelligence , but he learned a very valuable lesson from a passing aircraft , and that ' s that terrestrial technology can inter ##fere with the search for extra ##ter ##rest ##rial technology .

many socio ##logist ##s like veb ##len and wolfe would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously is because we ' re sn ##ob ##s , because we ' re focused on status .

well birds are pretty hard - wired , as it happens , so most of that is already in their dna , but to supplement it , part of ben ' s idea is to use homi ##ng pigeon ##s to help train the young passenger pigeon ##s how to fl ##ock and how to find their way to their old nesti ##ng grounds and feeding grounds .
another interesting project , though it ' s going to need some help , is the northern white rhin ##oce ##ros .

what does it cost to treat a classroom down to that 0 . 4 - second reve ##rb ##eration time ?

will you like all your children ? of course not .
now , this is one model of how language comes to be : namely , it ' s legi ##sla ##ted by an academy .
a hand ##y thing to have , because language is infinite , and you can ' t just par ##rot back the sentence ##s that you ' ve heard .
you can think of this as the language of thought , or " mentale ##se . "
now , i ' m sure most of you have seen the movie " far ##go . "
in dating , the transition from friendship to sex can lead to , notorious ##ly , various forms of aw ##kwa ##rd ##ness , and as can sex in the work ##place , in which we call the conflict between a dominant and a sexual relationship " sexual hara ##ss ##ment . "
so you get the best of both worlds .
i tend to win those arguments , because i know the trick ##s .
so we have these models - - argument as war , argument as proof , and argument as performance .
oh , and one more thing , and as an educator , this is the one that really both ##ers me : if argument is war , then there ' s an imp ##lici ##t equation of learning with losing .
what we need is new exit strategies for arguments .
why do we argue ? to out - reason our opponents , prove them wrong , and , most of all , to win ! . . . right ? philosopher daniel h . cohen shows how our most common form of argument - - a war in which one person must win and the other must lose - - miss ##es out on the real benefits of eng ##aging in active disa ##gre ##ement . & lt ; em & gt ; & lt ; / em & gt ;
this is learning something , learning an idea , from an organi ##sm and then apply ##ing it .
learning about the natural world is one thing ; learning from the natural world - - that ' s the switch .
life can ' t af ##ford to do that . how does life make things ?
imagine making all of our hard materials that way .
power of shape : here ' s a whale . we ' ve seen that the fins of this whale have tube ##rc ##les on them . and those little bu ##mps actually increase efficiency in , for instance , the edge of an airplane - - increase efficiency by about 32 percent .
and we use all of them , even the toxic ones .
ok , so that ' s the healing one .
and in ways both big and small , the narrative of the victim shape ##s the way we see women .
why are you so passion ##ate ? "
micro ##fina ##nce is an inc ##redi ##bly powerful tool that leads to self - su ##ffi ##cien ##cy and self - respect , but we must move beyond micro - hopes and micro - ambition ##s for women , because they have so much greater hopes for themselves .
you know why ?
and when i was apply ##ing to business school and felt certain i couldn ' t do it and nobody i knew had done it , i went to my aunt who survived years of beating ##s at the hand of her husband and escaped a marriage of abuse with only her dig ##nity intact .
but it was a little bit bor ##ing .
but the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure , consistent novel ##ty .
and now all bet ##s are off .
and yet , all the press is focused on that .
about 10 years ago , i was at a coc ##kta ##il party with a friend of mine , and we ' re sitting there , and he was comp ##lain ##ing about the crow ##s that he had seen that were all over his yard and making a big mess .
and in all that area , they ' re only rarely found breeding more than five kilometers away from human beings .
so , it turns out we ' ve been finding more and more that crow ##s are really , really intelligent .
in fact , that ' s old hat for crow ##s .
so , when they get really used to that , we move on to the crow ##s coming back .
i think that crow ##s can be trained to do other things .
so the management of electro ##lux took our pile , our list of ince ##nti ##ves , and they went outside the room for 17 minutes , and they came back in and they said , " wow , this is the most genero ##us any community has ever been to try to keep jobs here .
as we know , only half the states have op ##ted in .
every region has something to offer , and if you created a competition , it respect ##s the states and it respect ##s federal ##ism .
if you had ##n ' t notice ##d , our media climate generally provides a very dis ##tor ##ted mirror of our lives and of our gender , and i think that ' s going to change .
when they ' re monitoring your click ##stre ##am - - and you know they are - - they have a really hard time figur ##ing out your age , your gender and your income .
the future entertainment media that we ' re going to see is going to be very data - driven , and it ' s going to be based on the information that we as ##cer ##tain from taste communities online , where women are really driving the action .
up goes the bird , out come the words , " juan ##ito , juan ##ito , vente a comer mi hijo ! "
you might wanna aver ##t your gaz ##e , because that is a new ##t about to regen ##erate its lim ##b , and sha ##king hands spread ##s more ger ##ms than kiss ##ing .
oka ##y . now on the left you can see the hand - - that ' s the big arrow - - and the penis on the right . the hand ho ##veri ##ng .
and i said , " so , could you do it right here ? "
i actually suggested to - - there is a researcher at the university of alabama who does org ##as ##m research .
doctors back then were routine ##ly telling men the importance of pl ##eas ##uring their wives .
british sexo ##logist roy levin has spec ##ulated that this is perhaps why men evolved to be such ent ##hus ##ias ##tic and frequent mast ##ur ##bato ##rs .
and i said , " so why don ' t you just sti ##mula ##te the cl ##itori ##s of the pig ?
and the woman would have sex with it .
and yet , despite everything going really well for john , he was str ##uggling , fighting addiction and a grip ##ping depression .
now i know that seems ludi ##cro ##us .
pull the kn ##ot .
and it seemed to me even he felt really bad facing these unor ##gan ##ized red square ##s day after day .
we are only happy when things are in order .
so we can also see that very clearly in this next painting .
and i think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this .
but after a while , i just decided here to go all the way and put the paint back into the can ##s .
and i started to bring some order into some flags .
he had a dixie ##land jazz band when we were growing up , and he would always cover louis armstrong tunes .
and mom ##s grab their kids out of the way and say , " don ' t stare ! "
that ' s right , that ' s right ; i ' m no longer a victim .
it ' s as though intent is an essential component for humanity .
in fact , maybe that ' s the problem .
they were trying to answer the question of what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive ?
i was in a wheel ##cha ##ir ; i didn ' t look like a lo ##ote ##r .
this is what we must demand of our lives , of our objects , of our things , of our circumstances : living with intent .
i didn ' t have an exact address , but i knew his name , abe ##d , i knew that he lived in a town of 15 , 000 , k ##far kara , and i knew that , 21 years before , just outside this holy city , he broke my neck .
but abe ##d did not slow , and on that xe ##rox ##ed piece of paper , my neck again broke , and again , i was left without anger .
were all of us the results of things done to us , done for us , the inf ##idel ##ity of a parent or spo ##use , money inherited ?
and as i sat contem ##pla ##ting what to say , a woman approached in a black shaw ##l and black robe .
no , i was quiet . i was quiet because i had not come for truth .
" um , abe ##d , " i said , " i thought you had a few driving issues before the crash . "
yes , contrast .
i built the head . they built the body .
and it sees multiple people in a scene , remember ##s where individual people are , and looks from person to person , remember ##ing people .
someone invited me to a meeting , but couldn ' t manage to fit me in to a regular sort of conference room meeting , and said , " i have to walk my dogs tomorrow . could you come then ? "
and i did a little calculation of this .
for example , dan pink ' s talk on motivation , which was pretty good if you haven ' t seen it : " drop carro ##t . drop stick . bring meaning . "
they used their six words to talk back to me and ask me if i ' d been too much on google late ##ly .
and i would only pay $ 99 . 50 - - so stay even below a hundred dollars for it .
oka ##y , part one starts back in 1929 when the great astronom ##er edwin hubble realized that the distant galaxies were all rush ##ing away from us , establishing that space itself is stretch ##ing , it ' s expanding .
expressed in the relevant unit , it is spec ##ta ##cular ##ly small .
so particle masses , the strength ##s of forces , and most important ##ly , the amount of dark energy would be determined by the shape of the extra dimensions .
and in those universe ##s that have much less dark energy , well they collapse back on themselves so quickly that , again , galaxies don ' t form .
because such a mechanism has been found by cos ##mol ##ogist ##s trying to understand the big bang .
you see , we learned that our universe is not static , that space is expanding , that that expansion is speed ##ing up and that there might be other universe ##s all by care ##fully ex ##ami ##ning fai ##nt pin ##point ##s of star ##light coming to us from distant galaxies .
we can understand how to understand the data from the micro ##wave background radiation that was set down 13 . 72 billion years ago - - and yet , we can do calculation ##s today to pred ##ic ##t how it will look and it matches .
you ' re going to meet milo for the first time .
you can lean back , but the camera will change its perspective depending on which way you ' re looking .
milo : i wonder how deep it is .
now , to do that , we needed a set up , like a magic ##ian ' s trick .
you clean ##ed up my room .
and suddenly she sees a tank amb ##ling down the main road of sarajevo knock ##ing everything out of its path .
i believe a story there has to be told .
and that ' s pretty much why i do it .
and all i can really do is hope , not to policy ##makers or politicians , because as much as i ' d like to have faith that they read my words and do something , i don ' t delu ##de myself .
and that ' s exactly what we did 10 years ago .
just fast forward 10 years .
as fast as we can res ##et our computers , the brain activity shift ##s to start representing this new tool , as if this too was a part of that prima ##te ' s body .
and i was five years old , and i never understood why nasa didn ' t hire captain kirk and spo ##ck to do the job ; after all , they were very profi ##cient - - but just seeing that as a kid made me believe , as my grandmother used to tell me , that " impossible is just the possible that someone has not put in enough effort to make it come true . "
why would we waste this money on you ? "
and that brings me to my first major of two ten ##ets of " half the sky . "
in india , in the first year of life , from zero to one , boy and girl bab ##ies basica ##lly survive at the same rate because they depend upon the breast , and the breast shows no son preference .
so what would some of the specific challenges look like ?
so that meant she was inc ##ont ##inen ##t ; she couldn ' t control her waste ##s .
well , when she had her second daughter , her mother in - law told her son , " i think you ' d better get a second wife .
the twins started producing milk .
we also think that individuals can make a difference , and they should , because individuals , together , we can all help create a movement .
she ##ryl wu ##dun ##n ' s book " half the sky " investigate ##s the opp ##ression of women global ##ly . her stories shock . only when women in developing countries have equal access to education and economic opportunity will we be using all our human resources .
why not ? i mean , that ' s what we do .
and this cumu ##lati ##ve cultural adaptation , as ant ##hr ##op ##ologist ##s call this acc ##umu ##lation of ideas , is responsible for everything around you in your bust ##ling and tee ##ming everyday lives .
the other option we could choose was to develop the systems of communication that would allow us to share ideas and to cooper ##ate amongst others .
and this is why our species has pro ##sper ##ed around the world while the rest of the animals sit behind bars in zoo ##s , lang ##uis ##hing .
and this is also true of some remote oceanic islands .
to put it this way , nature knows no other ci ##rc ##ums ##tan ##ce in which functional ##ly equivalent traits co ##ex ##ist .
biologi ##st mark page ##l shares an intr ##igu ##ing theory about why humans evolved our complex system of language . he suggests that language is a piece of " social technology " that allowed early human tribes to access a powerful new tool : cooperation .
and what i ' m most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its accompanying image , and how the image is transformed by the text and the text by the image .
this is the only federal ##ly funded site where it is legal to cult ##ivat ##e cannabis for scientific research in the united states .
this is the death star .
for the men in these photographs , the primary cause of their wrong ##ful conviction was mistake ##n identification .
he ended up serving 18 and a half years of an 80 year sentence for rape and robb ##ery .
last year alone , 99 federal ##ly declared disaster ##s were on file with fem ##a , from jo ##plin , missouri , and tus ##calo ##osa , alabama , to the central texas wild ##fire ##s that just happened recently .
so the first idea i had , initially , was just to go the federal and state governments and go , " here , take it , for free . "
our school would show bill nye the science guy .
we have dawn orbit ##ing vest ##a , and we have over here new horizons on a straight shot to pluto .
there ' s a point to be made here .
so given that that ' s true , how good are we at increasing our happiness ?
we also find that people are more aver ##se to losing than they are happy to gain .
so when people ' s symptoms go away , they tend to recu ##r , because there isn ' t a sense of the other half - - of what pleasure , happiness , comp ##ass ##ion , gra ##titude , what are the positive emotions .
it would ##n ' t eat . it would ##n ' t sleep . it would ##n ' t have sex .
and even studies of cooperation show that cooperation between individuals lights up reward centers of the brain .
i seize command by physical pro ##wes ##s , and i keep it by beating my chest , and you make sub ##mis ##sive ges ##tures .
i end with a few quote ##s .
why would you choose rats ?
once the animal knows click , food , click , food , click , food - - so click is food - - we bring it in a cage with a hole , and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target sc ##ent is placed , and to do that for five seconds - - five seconds , which is long for a rat .
it means that , if you have t . b . , you have more chance that you won ' t be det ##ected , but will just die from t . b . secondary infections and so on .
and by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and loop ##ing those results back , we were able to increase case detection rates by over 30 percent .
and this is truly the most amazing thing in the world .
now , what is the significance of these mirror neu ##rons ?
in other words , if somebody touche ##s me , my hand , neu ##ron in the soma ##tos ##ens ##ory cortex in the sensor ##y region of the brain fires .
it emerge ##s from our understanding of basic neu ##ros ##cien ##ce .
so , that ' s 20 micro ##meter ##s across , that poll ##en grain there .
this is a bee ' s leg with the poll ##en gl ##omme ##d onto it from a mall ##ow plant .
four very different habitats might look similar , but they ' ve got very different poll ##en signature ##s .
it ' s certainly what i learned when i was training .
we have effective therapie ##s now .
and she started , the women ' s health initiative .
some women have those heart attacks , but a whole bun ##ch of women have this kind of heart attack , where it ero ##des , doesn ' t completely fill with cl ##ot , symptoms are sub ##tle , ek ##g findings are different - - female - pattern .
now what are the implications of that ?
and those little red boxes are deaths .
we still have two to three more women dying for every man .
so if we can be as good as breast cancer and give women this new charge , we have a lot of lives to save .
we copy this in the lab by out ##fit ##ting cell culture systems with electro ##des .
and in the case of the flora in our gut , these cells may not even be human .
but there ' s also a scientific reason that drove this project , which was to use this natural longitud ##inal data to understand the process of how a child learns language - - that child being my son .
the way to interpret this apparently simple graph is , on the vertical is an indication of how complex care ##giver ut ##tera ##nces are based on the length of ut ##tera ##nces .
now we free ##ze the action , 30 minutes , we turn time into the vertical axis , and we open up for a view of these interaction traces we ' ve just left behind .
this has become my favorite way of video ##graph ##ing just about any space .
and there are , again , now ten ##s of millions of these links that give us the connect ##ive tissue of social graph ##s and how they re ##late to content .
and then i went on to reflect , " isn ' t it amazing , this entire database , all these recordings , i ' m going to hand off to you and to your sister " - - who arrived two years later - - " and you guys are going to be able to go back and re - experience moments that you could never , with your biological memory , possibly remember the way you can now ? "
mit researcher deb roy wanted to understand how his infant son learned language - - so he wired up his house with video ##cam ##eras to catch every moment of his son ' s life , then pars ##ed 90 , 000 hours of home video to watch " ga ##aa ##a " slowly turn into " water . " aston ##ishing , data - rich research with deep implications for how we learn .
a second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream .
we make meaning by seeing , by an act of visual inter ##roga ##tion .
second ##ly , making them interactive .
this is a lau ##nd ##ry chute , and this right here is a shoe last .
but i get a lot of toile ##ts , and so you just dis ##pat ##ch a toile ##t with a hammer , and then you have lu ##mp ##y til ##es .
but you ' ve never seen this one before .
and in there he said that cultures tend to swing between one of two perspectives .
and so if something isn ' t standard , " oo ##ps , dum ##ps ##ter . " " oo ##ps " this . " oo ##ps , war ##ped . "
the problem is we can ' t af ##ford it .
all we have to do is look at what one company did with carbon ##ated pr ##une juice .
that ex ##ace ##rb ##ates and continues this model .
that is , our housing has become a com ##mod ##ity .
in this funny and insight ##ful talk , builder dan phillips tours us through a dozen homes he ' s built in texas using rec ##yc ##led and rec ##lai ##med materials in wild ##ly creative ways . brilliant , low - tech design details will ref ##res ##h your own creative drive . & lt ; em & gt ; & lt ; / em & gt ;
and the reason i think it would be so interesting to you is because consciousness is so interesting .
there is no more dra ##stic and sudden gap created between potential and actual mind than a severe head injury .
but if you look into the eye of consciousness , that single eye you can see , i ' m looking down , but let me tell you how i felt at that point .
the global perspective is that up to 30 percent of children in school have learning weak ##ness ##es that are not self - correct ##ing , but with appropriate treatment , they can be screen ##ed for and det ##ected and correct ##ed and avoid their academic failure .
the answer is yes , and for the first time , it ' s my pleasure to be able to share two examples .
imagine the blood flowing through your body - - i was told at ucla medical center - - as one seal ##ed system .
so it goes in and it stay ##s there .
and so i was sitting in this restaurant , waiting for a man to come by who obvious ##ly would have some difficulty . . .
and if you walk faster , if i walk faster , it det ##ect ##s what ' s called the time interval , which is the interval between each heel lift .
and i started in our medical university , karol ##inska institute , an undergraduate course called global health . but when you get that opportunity , you get a little nervous . i thought , these students coming to us actually have the highest grade you can get in swedish college systems - - so , i thought , maybe they know everything i ' m going to teach them about . so i did a pre - test when they came .
now what has happened since 1962 ? we want to see the change .
where are the different countries ? i can show you africa .
yemen , civil war . united arab emir ##ate , money which was quite equally and well used .
everything in this world exists in africa . and you can ' t discuss universal access to hiv [ medicine ] for that qui ##nti ##le up here with the same strategy as down here . the improvement of the world must be highly context ##uali ##zed , and it ' s not relevant to have it on regional level . we must be much more detailed .
and that ' s a quite cle ##ver guy , hu ##h ?
but it slightly bore ##s me .
so i had a really quite happy life at indiana .
and certainly , neither cr ##ick or i were chem ##ists , so we tried to build a model . and he knew , francis knew wilkins .
and i read it , and it was just - - it was cr ##ap .
and we knew we were right .
but that ' s the only - - no , we were only photograph ##ed twice .
so , we started with breast cancer because there ' s lots of money for it , no government money .
were they crazy also , and we didn ' t know it ?
you need to know that the average patent tro ##ll defense costs two million dollars and takes 18 months when you win .
now what did i learn from this case ? well , three things .
be ##hold , patent inf ##ringe ##ment via mobile device - - defined as a computer which is not station ##ary .
it was a huge success .
they lau ##ghed together .
now i bet , in this audience , you ' re thinking of some really incredible technology , some stuff that i haven ' t even heard of , i ' m absolute ##ly sure .
bruce ay ##l ##ward : oo ##ps . jon , poli ##o ' s almost been era ##dica ##ted .
so what we ' re looking for is a permanent solution .
it det ##eri ##ora ##tes so quickly in the trop ##ics that we ' ve had to put this special va ##cci ##ne monitor on every single via ##l so that it will change very quickly when it ' s exposed to too much heat , and we can tell that it ' s not a good va ##cci ##ne to use on a child - - it ' s not pote ##nt ; it ' s not going to protect them .
within a couple of years , every country that started poli ##o era ##dica ##tion rapidly era ##dica ##ted all three of their poli ##o virus ##es , with the exception of four countries that you see here .
he lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters .
and this started an incredible collaboration with industry , and within six months , we were testing a new poli ##o va ##cci ##ne that targeted , just two years ago , the last two types of poli ##o in the world .
it ' s ready to reach them with bed nets , with other things .
and is it easy to raise that money ?
and she took us on a journey and revealed something very special to us - - her own daughter , eight days old .
dj : now one of the big things , of course , everybody knows that cats hate water , and so this was a real revelation for us .
b ##j : so , as der ##eck says , we have to work through extreme ##s - - extreme temperatures , push ours ##el ##ves at night .
it was phenomena ##l , and we felt gra ##te ##ful that she trust ##ed us to that extent .
but i have to tell you - - everybody always asks , " what happened to the baby bab ##oon ? "
and that ' s probably because we haven ' t seen it like we are today .
my title : " queer ##er than we can suppose : the strange ##ness of science . "
science has taught us , against all int ##uit ##ion , that apparently solid things , like crystal ##s and rocks , are really almost entirely composed of empty space .
if we ' d evolved in a vacuum , we would ex ##pect them to hit the ground simultaneously . if we were bacteria , constantly bu ##ffet ##ed by thermal movements of molecules , it would be different , but we middle world ##ers are too big to notice brown ##ian motion .
what we see of the real world is not the un ##var ##nis ##hed world but a model of the world , regulated and adjusted by sense data , but constructed so it ' s useful for dealing with the real world .
miracles are just events that are extremely imp ##ro ##bab ##le .
we ' d be different , our characters would be different , if our neu ##ro - anatomy and our phys ##iol ##ogical chemistry were different .
i went to notre dame university and graduated with degrees in accounting and german , including spending a year of study in austria .
all of us have disa ##bilities in one form or another .
can you show us how good of a pilot you are ?
moving on from this , the next person to explore this field was a gentleman called hans jenny in the 1970s .
then on the right we can see a c ##yma ##tica ##lly created snow ##fla ##ke .
their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and , as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience , change became not only possible , but ine ##vita ##ble .
and it ' s ter ##rib ##ly endangered .
and you don ' t necessarily have the sense that twitter is in fact a very heavily brazilian space .
it ' s the economy of moving these heavy , slow atoms over long distances that ' s very difficult to do .
you start looking at how the global plane flights move , and you suddenly discover that the world isn ' t even close to flat .
when you look at the new york times , you look at other elite media , what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations and the nations we ' ve in ##vade ##d .
nor do i think we are by ours ##el ##ves , actually going to solve the problem .
there ' s a group right now in china called ye ##ey ##an .
not only does she have to keep our israeli and palestinian contributo ##rs from killing each other , she has to figure out what is going to interest you about the middle east .
he knows one world , and he ' s finding a way to commun ##icate it to another world , both of which he has deep connections to .
we have to fix our immigration policy .
in afghanistan , for example , we haven ' t just had one election or two elections . we ' ve gone through three elections , presidential and parliamentary . and what do we find ?
it ' s not that it gua ##rante ##es peace with itself or with its nei ##gh ##bors .
the public is losing faith in democracy , says british mp rory stewart . iraq and afghanistan ' s new demo ##c ##rac ##ies are deeply cor ##rupt ; meanwhile , 84 percent of people in britain say politics is broken . in this important talk , stewart sounds a call to action to re ##bu ##ild democracy , starting with rec ##og ##ni ##zing why democracy is important - - not as a tool , but as an ideal .
the short answer is , actually , they ' re from japan .
this is a billboard that says : " welcome to the birth ##place of general ts ##o . "
let ' s go back to mid - 1800 ##s when the chinese first came to america .
for example , there is french chinese food , where they serve salt and pepper frog legs .
so , like , ok , maybe it had to do with the patterns on the little pieces of paper - - you know , like , it was a diamond , or , you know , diagonal .
so me , general ts ##o ' s chicken and this logo are all karma ##cal ##ly related .
finally , in about the sixteen ##th century , a physician whose name was theo ##ph ##ras ##tus bombas ##tus aur ##eo ##lus von hohen ##heim , called para ##cel ##sus , a name probably familiar to some people here - - - - good , old para ##cel ##sus found that he could pred ##ic ##t the degree of con ##vu ##lsi ##on by using a measured amount of camp ##hor to produce the con ##vu ##lsi ##on .
he re ##lap ##sed a little bit , they gave him a series of treatment ##s , and he was essentially cure ##d .
it had to do with being brought up in a family where no one spoke english , no one could read or write english .
and they tried everything they had .
well , he said , " can ' t we try a course of electro ##sh ##ock therapy ? "
and things got better and better , and within three or four months , i was discharge ##d from that hospital , and i joined a group of surgeon ##s where i could work with other people in the community , not in new haven , but fairly close by .
so one of the reasons that i have come here to talk about this today is to - - frank ##ly , self ##ish ##ly - - un ##bur ##den myself and let it be known that this is not an un ##tro ##uble ##d mind that has written all of these books .
i believe the concept of global citizenship will simply grow out of people talking to each other across continents .
now , what is remarkable is that civil rights in america were achieved in the 1960s .
but i think this is the fru ##strat ##ion that perhaps a lot people have , like people in the audience here , where we love the kind of language that you ' re talking about .
and we have had a speaker who said that very thing , and sw ##allo ##wed a sword right after that , which was quite dramatic .
i mean , the great difficulty in europe is if you ' re at a meeting and 27 people speak , it takes a very very long time .
and then the secretary general of the united nations " when will our international institutions work ? "
so the question is , how do you rein ##vent something that has been around for five mille ##nni ##a ?
and the most remarkable feat is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that .
and you see here a picture of a tissue section .
some of the greatest innovations and developments in the world often happen at the intersection of two fields .
if you don ' t like the subject or the performance , you can hold the red .
data : a couple of new jersey hunters are out in the woods .
so this is actually the first time we ' ve ever done live audience feedback to a performance .
what can we do together that benefits us both ?
strange ##ness is that cali ##bra ##tion of close ##ness and distance that enable ##s me to find the people that i need right now , that enable ##s me to find the sources of inti ##mac ##y , of discovery , and of inspiration that i need right now .
it all began for him during world war ii , when at age 17 he found himself th ##rust into a forge ##d documents workshop .
i was born in algeria .
so at the age of 14 my father had to work .
but it was only the beginning .
he also explained to me that i had a brother , too , and the first time i saw them i must have been three or four , and they were 30 years older than me .
europe was not spare ##d either .
this is bad news , but perhaps sur ##pris ##ing to you , it ' s also part of the good news .
never have we seen , in the past 50 years , such a sharp decline of eco ##system functions and services on the planet , one of them being the ability to regula ##te climate on the long term , in our forests , land and biodiversity .
as a side ##line , you know that the only red flag that pop ##ped up here was a submarine from an un ##name ##d country that planted a red flag at the bottom of the arctic to be able to control the oil resources .
what you see here in black line is the safe operating space , the quant ##ified boundaries , as suggested by this analysis .
under the realizat ##ion from tourist operators , fisher ##men , the australian great barrier reef authority and scientists that the great barrier reef is doom ##ed under the current governance regime .
the key though in all of these , the red thread , is the shift in minds ##et , moving away from a situation where we simply are push ##ing ours ##el ##ves into a dark future , where we instead back ##cast our future , and we say , " what is the playing field on the planet ?
though it ' s actually true , you know , the reason i ' m talking to you right now is because i was born in brazil .
but i wasn ' t into selling w ##his ##key ; i was into selling ice .
" the snail . "
this is " 6 , 500 yards , " after coro ##t . " 9 , 000 yards , " after gerhard richter .
they do a dna sc ##an of this , they will come up with a great mail ##ing list .
a hang ##er .
and we can then see the result of such mutations when we compare dna sequences among us here in the room , for example .
and later , between 100 and 50 , 000 years ago or so , went out of africa to colon ##ize the rest of the world .
there is another thing with those traits that we so easily observe in each other that i think is worth ##while to consider , and that is that , in a very literal sense , they ' re really on the surface of our bodies .
statistical ##ly speaking , there is no difference in how often the nea ##ndert ##hal matches one african or the other .
they meet nea ##ndert ##hal ##s , mix with them , continue to spread over the world , and somewhere in southeast asia , they meet denis ##ovan ##s and mix with them and continue on out into the pacific .
so sus ##tain ##ability is quite important for us , which should incorpora ##te social but as well as environmental and economic values .
so let ' s compare the old world with the new world .
we have social areas inside the aircraft which might turn into a place where you can play virtual golf .
these are survival skills .
this is our body wisdom . it ' s not something that is media ##ted by our language . our body just knows that , and we ' ve known that for a long time .
there are millions of individuals with aut ##ism all around us .
well , it ' s hard to do that , so we had to create the technologies . we had to basica ##lly step inside a body .
it ' s almost as if that sti ##mul ##us , you , you ' re not ex ##erti ##ng influence on what happens as they navi ##gate their daily lives .
early diagnosis of aut ##ism spectrum disorder can improve the lives of everyone affected , but the complex network of causes make it inc ##redi ##bly difficult to pred ##ic ##t . at ted ##x ##pea ##cht ##ree , ami kl ##in describes a new early detection method that uses eye - tracking technologies to gauge bab ##ies ' social engagement skills and re ##lia ##bly measure their risk of developing aut ##ism . & lt ; em & gt ; & lt ; / em & gt ;
if you ' re an out ##board personnel , now you stand up .
you are going to hit the ground .
i was raised with traditional stories of leadership : robert e . lee , john bu ##ford at gett ##ys ##burg .
more important ##ly , the force that i led was spread over more than 20 countries .
i asked , " where were you on 9 / 11 ? "
i learned they are the sine ##w which hold the force together .
and if you ' re a leader , the people who count on you need you on your feet .
she then assigned these works racial ide ##nti ##ties , basica ##lly saying to me that the work on the right , clearly , was made by a black artist , the work on the left , clearly , by a white artist , when , in effect , that was the opposite case : bob coles ##cott , african - american artist ; leon golu ##b , a white artist .
what that might mean for cultural movements all over this moment , the " me , we " seems inc ##redi ##bly pres ##cient totally important .
so , what do i discover when i look at artwork ##s ?
they download ##ed it from disney . com , or one of these websites , 14 days after putting the computer in their village .
this is a 15 year - old boy .
i called in 26 children .
but 30 percent is not a pass .
i gave them six gc ##se questions .
you can ' t catch me .
they type ##d it into google , translated it into italian , went back into italian google .
[ " oed ##ip ##us rex " ] [ " the lion king " ] [ " titus " ] [ " frida " ] [ " the magic flute " ] [ " across the universe " ] julie tay ##mor : thank you . thank you very much .
the next moment , as soon as they finished and disappeared into the shadows , a young man with a prop ##ane lantern came on , hung it up on a tree , set up a curta ##in .
i love the apparent truth of theater .
ariel : i board ##ed the king ' s ship . in every cabin , i flame ##d ama ##zem ##ent .
and as she was there on the edge of that stage , two stage ##hand ##s all in black with water ##ing can ##s ran along the top and started to pour water on the sand castle , and the sand castle started to dr ##ip and sin ##k , but before it did , the audience saw the black - cl ##ad stage ##hand ##s .
what the hell are we doing up there on that stage ?
julie tay ##mor : spider - man , the lion king and life on the creative edge
you choose . it ' s your baker ##y , your street , your country - - not mine . "
and so , on a micro level , there ' s a real role for this combination of investment and phil ##ant ##hr ##op ##y .
and i really understood what patient capital meant emotional ##ly in the last month or so . because the company was literally 10 days away from pro ##ving that the product they produced was at the world - quality level needed to make coa ##rte ##m , when they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history .
in our first year , the first net went off the line in october of 2003 .
she was very much like those women sitting behind the se ##wing machines .
now , when we first started talking to ok go - - the name of the song is " this too shall pass " - - we were really ex ##cite ##d because they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with .
the machine itself would start the music .
it doesn ' t matter what temperature it is , doesn ' t matter what ' s in its way ; it will pretty much get where it needs to go .
and now to introduce their music video , we have ok go .
and so we built some very so ##phis ##tica ##ted radio antenna ##s just for pro ##bing both walls and searching for an air gap .
so we thought of an augmente ##d reality application using a tablet . let me show you just sim ##ulat ##ing what we could be doing , any of us could be doing , in a museum environment .
and the later it fails , the worse the consequences .
it ' s a disease that runs in my family , and we really hope that cells like these will help us find a cure .
i ' ve tried to show in this - - though the color doesn ' t come out - - that what i ' m concerned with is the little 50 - year time bubble that you are in . you tend to be interested in a generation past , a generation future - - your parents , your kids , things you can change over the next few decades - - and this 50 - year time bubble you kind of move along in . and in that 50 years , if you look at the population curve , you find the population of humans on the earth more than doubles and we ' re up three - and - a - half times since i was born . when you have a new baby , by the time that kid gets out of high school more people will be added than existed on earth when i was born .
your great - great grand ##pare ##nts got by on muscle power , and yet we all think there ' s this huge power that ' s essential for our lifestyle . and with all the wonderful technology we have we can do things that are much more efficient : conserve , rec ##yc ##le , etc .
it ' s part of a long - term program nasa sponsored .
all right .
well , inspired by the sentence ##s , i decided to wie ##ld the paint ##bru ##sh .
thank you .
" it ' d be like putting a piece of toa ##st through a basketball hoop , would ##n ' t it ? "
over thousands of years ago , he proved that for us .
he proved it was prime with nothing more than a qui ##ll , ink , paper and his mind .
it took him , by his estimate , " three years of sunday ##s . "
it ' s because of curtis cooper that we know , currently the largest prime number we know , is 2 ^ 57 , 885 , 161 .
we live in an age where some of the great breakthrough ##s are not going to happen in the labs or the halls of academia but on lap ##top ##s , desktop ##s , in the palm ##s of people ' s hands who are simply helping out for the search .
and what was so gorge ##ous about this discovery was 50 years ago peter hi ##ggs and his team considered one of the deep ##est of all questions : how is it that the things that make us up have no mass ?
in fact , growing up in tasmania , it always was inc ##redi ##bly ex ##citi ##ng when we got a chance to see a tasmania ##n devil in the wild .
scientists around the world were intr ##igue ##d by this cancer , this inf ##ect ##ious cancer , that was spread ##ing through the tasmania ##n devil population .
he ' s a tasmania ##n devil that we found with a large tumor on his face .
he ' s a dog that belongs to a family in mom ##basa in kenya .
however , under some circumstances , it can happen .
so if we ' re married , we ' re more likely to have kids .
so most of us put ours ##el ##ves above average on most of these abilities .
number two : regardless of the outcome , the pure act of antic ##ip ##ation makes us happy .
so they tend to ex ##pect the future to be worse than it ends up being .
but if someone started off saying , " my average like ##lih ##ood of suffering from cancer is about 10 percent , " and we said , " hey , bad news .
and what he ' s doing is he ' s passing a small magnetic pulse through the skull of the participant in our study into their inferior frontal g ##yrus .
and i believe there ' s a way for us to do that .
it really should be called the recovery or return of asia .
but think of what it does to how we think in traditional terms and concepts .
the te ##cto ##nic plates of world politics were shift ##ing .
you know , it looks at economic power measured by gdp .
and as i said earlier , china has not passed the united states .
now i don ' t mean to be polly ##anna ##ish about this .
in fact , they ' ve account ##ed for half of all civil wars .
and why is it so difficult initially ?
so the dono ##rs have to stick with this situation for at least a decade .
and indeed , unfortunately , if you navi ##gate by needs you get a very un ##fo ##cus ##ed agenda , because in these situations , needs are every ##w ##here , but the capacity to implement change is very limited .
there ' s one sector which isn ' t exposed to international trade , and which can generate a lot of jobs , and which is , in any case , a sensible sector to expand , post - conflict , and that is the construction sector .
the planning function and policy function stay ##s with the ministry ; the delivery of services on the ground , you should use whatever works - - churches , ngo ##s , local communities , whatever works .

they were ##n ' t willing to engage in this .
well , in 1900 , three percent of americans practiced profession ##s that were cognitive ##ly demand ##ing .
now over the last century , in developed nations like america , moral debate has escala ##ted because we take the hy ##pot ##hetic ##al seriously , and we also take universal ##s seriously and look for logical connections .
you have to say , well , black ##ness of skin , you couldn ' t suffer just for that .
one of the ways in which we would like to deal with the so ##phis ##tica ##tion of the modern world is through politics , and sad ##ly you can have human ##e moral principles , you can class ##ify , you can use logic on abstract ##ions , and if you ' re ign ##oran ##t of history and of other countries , you can ' t do politics .
i ' m a public school teacher , and i just want to share a story of my superintendent .
it could have been dent ##ist ##ry , but the word " experimental " was in it , and so that ' s what i had to go for .
it ' s a story that ' s a testament to teaching and teachers .
and so that ges ##ture of my mother ' s continues through many generations .
i offer them the job , they can turn it down , and then they choose their own cabinet .
see , mr . hunter is doing that because he says his time has messe ##d up a lot , and he ' s trying to tell us how to fix that problem .
this is the world peace game . what is wrong with you ? "
" let ' s ask that mom to read the letter .
this is about my friend brennan .

in india , we had the na ##xa ##lite movement , the [ unclear ] movement .
when you pump in air in a bicycle , you use a bit of this .
they always make a triangular roof .
now this is a little pump with which you could inf ##late a ball ##oon .
but this is great fun for children .
i just put this inside this .
they are fu ##sed together , so you can ' t separate them .
there are no patent ##s . anyone can make it .
this is called " the captain ' s hat story . "
and the ship sin ##ks , and the captain has lost everything , but for a life jacket .
so i ' m going to talk about some projects that have explore ##d these ideas .
the way we tend to use resources is we extra ##ct them , we turn them into short - life products and then dispose of them .
and we ' d also have a coffee shop , and the waste grain ##s from that could be used as a sub ##strat ##e for growing mus ##hr ##oom ##s .
so amazing example of an adaptation to a very resource - con ##stra ##ined environment - - and in that sense , very relevant to the kind of challenges we ' re going to be facing over the next few years , next few decades .
so this is how this scheme would look .
they ' re not just possible ; they ' re critical .
and if i want to start having children by the time i ' m 35 , that meant that i would have had to have been on my way to marriage five years ago .
now , there was one small catch .
and they say to me , " stop comp ##lain ##ing . "
for me , the ho ##bbi ##es that i have are really just new work projects that i ' ve launched .
she said she is " sil ##ly , nice and friendly . "
remember , i ' m somebody who said that i speak fl ##uent japanese and i know javascript and i was oka ##y with that .
obvious ##ly , i ' m having a fab ##ulous life , so - - - - the question is , what does all of this mean for you ?
i know most of you have had the experience of coming back home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games .
imagine you ' re driving in a fog . that makes a difference between seeing the car in front of you and avoid ##ing the accident , or getting into an accident .
but a few kids are sad and blue because they ' ve forgotten their coat .
that ' s a multimedia - task ##er .
so let me ill ##ust ##rate that step with a task which is called mental rotation .
daphne ba ##veli ##er : your brain on video games
you get something a little bit more complicated .
well , this has deep implications about the limits of science , about pred ##ic ##tab ##ility and control ##lab ##ility of things like biological processes or economie ##s , about intelligence in the universe , about questions like free will and about creating technology .
so let ' s try asking a question , like a health related question .
so , i ' m pretty please ##d with it all .
then , the idea is that wolfram alpha will be able to figure out what precise pieces of code can do what they ' re asking for and then show them examples that will let them pick what they need to build up bigger and bigger , precise programs .
but in at least a large class of cases , one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network , which , when it gets big enough , be ##hav ##es like continuous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can be ##hav ##e like a continuous fluid .
that was aston ##ishing .
there are very few doctors and , quite frank ##ly , these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cope with such epi ##dem ##ics .
and this is only done in four hours , 50 times faster than the current state of the art , at a cost that will be five to 500 times cheap ##er than the current options .
it ' s because my mother was denied an education , and she constantly remi ##nded me and my siblings that she never wanted us to live the life she was living .
well , my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass .
i was lucky because one , also , my mom did something that most women don ' t do .
this should have been given to a boy . we can ' t do this . "
i learned that she did not have to be abuse ##d because she is a woman .
and yes , she was older to be in fourth grade .
and we will live in a very peaceful world . thank you very much .
it took us 50 years to reach annual savings ratings of almost 10 percent . 50 years .
so we ' re starting to pay for things with money that we have .
we ' re going to go through four value - shift ##s that we see driving new consumer behavior ##s , that offer new management principles .
another quick example of these types of movements is the rise of z ##yn ##ga .
but they also talk about the fact that their executive ##s , all of their ex ##pense reports are put onto their company intra ##net for everyone to see .
another great example is fidel ##ity .
the traditional thing would be to boy ##cott right ?
it ' s been tre ##men ##dou ##sl ##y powerful for consumers .
i know a woman who ' s good at this .
go home to your husband - - what does he need ?
in fact , i grew up ob ##ser ##ving two different kinds of woman ##hood .
we tend to form clusters based on similar ##ity , and then we produce stereo ##type ##s about other clusters of people .
i skip ##ped school often and dream ##ed of becoming a sailor during those days .
for me , like millions of other people around the world today , english is an acquired language .
many authors feel this pressure , but non - western authors feel it more heavily .
but there were times when i wanted to remi ##nd both sides that this was fiction .
books have saved the intro ##verte ##d , tim ##id child that i was - - that i once was .
au ##dre lord ##e once said , " the white fathers taught us to say , ' i think , therefore i am . ' " she suggested , " i feel , therefore i am free . "
i think these are the basic elements of all creat ##ivity .
now , american copyright and patent laws run counter to this notion that we build on the work of others .
that is all there is to it . apple has patente ##d this .
he records a song called " blind willie mc ##tell , " named after the blues singer , and the song is a voyage through the past , through a much dark ##er time , but a simple ##r one , a time when musicians like willie mc ##tell had few illusion ##s about what they did .
just look at google maps here . there ' s block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
and one of the first victims of difficult economic times , i think , is public spending of any kind , but certainly in the firing line at the moment is public spending for science , and particularly cur ##ios ##ity - led science and exploration .
it ' s about 500 kilometers in diameter .
so below the ice , there ' s an ocean of liquid around the whole moon .
well , this looks like a picture of virtually nothing .
and one of the aston ##ishing prediction ##s of quantum mechanics , just by looking at the structure of atoms - - the same theory that describes trans ##istor ##s - - is that there can be no stars in the universe that have reached the end of their life that are bigger than , quite specifically , 1 . 4 times the mass of the sun .
it was made in stars like that , locked away and then returned to the universe in explosion ##s like that in order to rec ##onde ##nse into planets , stars , new solar systems and , indeed , people like us .
but it visited jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune .
thank you .
the red dot ##s you see up there are sites that are behavioral tracking that i have not navi ##gate ##d to , but are following me .
pretty simple - - it ' s huge business .
thank you for being here .
you ' re walking to make us feel bad . "
i was 27 . i thought i knew everything .
and they said , " don ' t wo ##rry about that . "
now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion .
my dad said , " that ' s one , " and i still didn ' t let that go .
i was walking through el dorado - - it ' s a prison town , famous prison , or inf ##amo ##us prison - - in venezuela , and i don ' t know what possessed me , because this was not like me .
but i know i needed to .
but even as a child , i could feel the he ##avi ##ness in their hearts .
hope kept me alive .
my father tried very hard to motiv ##ate me into studying , but it didn ' t work .
in north korea , i made it myself .
i just wanted to say that i miss you , and i love you , and please come back to me and stay alive .
i was asked to design the building , because the theme of the expo was environmental issues .
that ' s the responsibility of architects .
i started com ##mut ##ing to kobe , and i met the society of vietnamese people .
i brought my japanese students to work with the chinese students .
i used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfort ##able , within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfort ##able .
and those two roles came together for me in a book that i wrote called " origins . "
now why would this kind of fet ##al learning be useful ?
and often it does something more .
when food is scar ##ce , they dive ##rt nut ##rien ##ts towards the really critical organ , the brain , and away from other organs like the heart and liver .
but there ' s another way of thinking about pts ##d .
mt : this faith in the fictional is essential for any kind of theatrical experience .
the audience is led to make ass ##umption ##s or ela ##bora ##tions that are perfect ##ly reason ##able , but do not , in fact , match what is being done in front of them .
and if the story is a good one , it might even make us smile .
so what i ' m asking for is the creation of a new job title - - i ' ll come to this a little later - - and perhaps the addition of a new word into the english language .
but i was at a ted event recently and esther du ##fl ##o , probably one of the leading experts in , effectively , the era ##dica ##tion of poverty in the developing world , actually spoke .
one of them also being , although logical ##ly it ' s quite a good idea to have a lift with no up and down button in it , if it only serves two floors , it ' s actually bloody ter ##rif ##ying , oka ##y ?
because , if the board of directors convince everybody that the success of any organization is almost entirely dependent on the decisions made by the board of directors , it makes the dis ##pari ##ty in salaries slightly more just ##if ##ia ##ble than if you actually ac ##k ##now ##led ##ge that quite a lot of the credit for a company ' s success might actually lie somewhere else , in small pieces of tactical activity .
so the first thing i ' d like is a competition - - to any ##body watching this as a film - - is to come up with a name for that stuff on the bottom right .
i become the medium through which the music is being channel ##ed , and in the process , when all is right , the music is transformed and so am i .
because this is about 10 dollars of additional hardware if you already have a nintendo wii .
but i also learned very soon thereafter that jesus also said , and i ' m para ##ph ##rasi ##ng , the poor would always be with us .
the truth be told , i was giving out of that place , not out of a gen ##uine place of hope and ex ##cite ##ment to help and of generos ##ity .
for the first time , actually , in a long time i wanted to meet those individuals , i wanted to meet these entrepreneur ##s , and see for myself what their lives were actually about .
i just got this impression that the money would work .
because as that happens , i think we can feel free to intera ##ct in a way that ' s more open , more just and more creative , to engage with each other and to help each other .
so with that in mind , this particular incident has led to the things that i ' m working on now .
so that ' s what i ' m working on now .
there is nothing bigger or older than the universe .
the universe can spo ##ntan ##eous ##ly create itself out of nothing .
but we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history .
i ' m a designer and an educator .
in other words , i look for aliens , and when i tell people that at a coc ##kta ##il party , they usually look at me with a mild ##ly inc ##red ##ulous look on their face .
that ' s a degree of an improvement that would look good on your report card , oka ##y ?
so that ' s not so bad . i mean , even with two dozen years , you open up your browser and there ' s news of a signal , or you get a cup of coffee .
it would change his day , all right ?
these sort ##s of ideas don ' t really have any valid ##ity , that you can ' t trust the scientists .
this allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a hook to science , because set ##i involves all kinds of science , obvious ##ly biology , obvious ##ly astronomy , but also geology , also chemistry , various scientific disciplines all can be presented in the guise of , " we ' re looking for e . t . "
let me just say , look , my job is a pri ##vil ##ege because we ' re in a special time .
after i was invited by ted , i did some dig ##ging , because that ' s what we do , to know about my host .
you find elephant ##s , rhin ##os , monkey ##s , pig ##s , etc .
in a way , this was like the second birth for the child , after 3 . 3 million years , but the labor was very long .
what do we actually know about our ancestors ?
what does that tell us ? "
i think it ' s important to promote in a more positive way on how we see ours ##el ##ves .
for example , gar ##bage discharge , something you would think just simply goes away , but the laws regula ##ting ship discharge of gar ##bage actually get weak ##er the further you are from shore .
but the sar ##gas ##so sea , the same way it aggregate ##s sar ##gas ##sum wee ##d , actually is pull ##ing in the plastic from throughout the region .
getting closer to shore , where we are , this was in fact taken in the gala ##pagos .
at the same time we ' re saying , " yes , we need more . we need to move forward . "

he very care ##fully and met ##icu ##lou ##sl ##y notes his results in an exercise book .
and you know , with the future billion ##s that we ' ve been hearing about , the world is simply far too complex to understand in that way .
there are 100 , 000 there . it would take you all day .
i reali ##ze that ' s an amb ##igu ##ous statement .
even this problem , too complicated .
it didn ' t come because you put some inc ##redi ##bly smart person in charge .
it ' s so un ##com ##fort ##able .
would you like to close down the trial now , or should we wait until we have rob ##ust results ? "
but he made mistake ##s in a good direction .
it will stop because of the end of trade resources .
i find this argument fas ##cina ##ting , as though we can kind of bend the rules of physics to suit our needs .
i accept where we are .
imagine our highly - tune ##d , just - in - time food industry and our highly - stress ##ed agricultural system failing and super ##market she ##lve ##s empty ##ing .
think about war .
we need to act like the future depends on it .
and i will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate re ##boot looks like .
and we thought we were going to be able to lay these debt ##s off on our kids , but , gu ##ess what ?
everything else is mandate ##d .
that ' s the financial crisis .
graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in .
this should not surprise you , right ?
and all we ' ve got is a room ##ba .
and about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and i can , they ' ll be able to hear maybe how bats sing , or how whale ##s talk , or how dogs talk , and other types of tona ##l scales .
i think we ' re going to move from a homo sapiens into a homo evo ##lut ##is .
and the people thought , " you know , you ' re right .
so in every car crash in which at least one person dies , they have information on all of the people .
and so if we look at recent crash ##es - - the whole data set is almost 30 years ' worth of data - - you won ' t see it in the recent crash ##es . the new car seats are far , far better . "
so , let me show you what happens .
that ' s some more evidence , so in some sense - - i was criticized by a scientist , who said , " you could never publish a study with an n of 4 , " meaning those four crash ##es .
and it turned out that most people would ##n ' t come back , because it worked . but every once in a while , there was still a patient convinced that he was sick , and he ' d come back . and my dad had a third jar of pil ##ls .
it ' s in 5 , 000 days , all this stuff has come .
so , i was trying to basica ##lly make measurements .
so by the year 204 ##0 , the total processing of this machine will ex ##cee ##d a total processing power of humanity , in raw bits and stuff . and this is , i think , where ray kurz ##wei ##l and others get this little chart saying that we ' re going to cross .
right now , it ' s not . if you do spread ##she ##ets and things at work , a word document , they aren ' t on the web , but they are going to be . they ' re going to be part of this machine .
mc ##lu ##han was saying , " machines are the extensions of the human sense ##s . "
so every idea is basica ##lly being supported - - or every item , or every nou ##n - - is being supported by the entire web .
so we have this database of things .
but it ' ll antic ##ip ##ate what we ' re doing , in a good sense .
my journey to coming here today started in 1974 .
and so i decided to write a book , a memoir , about this decade of my life .
all i have to do is hum ##bly follow .
and i organize it . and , well , it ' s also a bit different because an architect versus , let ' s say , a dance company finally is a nego ##tia ##tion between one ' s private world , one ' s conceptual world , the world of ideas , the world of asp ##irati ##ons , of invention ##s , with the relationship of the exterior world and all the limita ##tions , the nay ##say ##ers .
and it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer , ob ##ser ##ving every kilometer a particular object of desire , and then placing that within this .
and then the broad ##er ideas of city - making start having direct influences on architecture , on the elements that make up the broad ##er scheme , the buildings themselves , and start gui ##ding us .
it ' s transparent , and it allows you to understand , i think , what is always the most interesting thing in any building , which is the actual construction ##al processes that make it .
we could talk about the relationship at a more biological sense of the relationship of building and ground .
they have 22 satellites zip ##ping around at plus or minus 100 miles , and the site ' s in red .
well , then we get to this image .
please , also on the bal ##cony .
you now , our brain is two to three percent of the body mass , but actually it uses 25 percent of the total energy we use .
you can continue to inn ##ovat ##e and in ##vent .
this is what we are using . "
it ' s this brain which makes this ref ##lex .
then we would generate something all of us would like to have - - a balance between the hunger and the sati ##ation .
and you could look at this art and you could , of course , see the complex social organization of the people who brought it into being .
10 , 000 square kilometers , ten ##s of thousands of islands fl ##ung like jewel ##s upon the southern sea .
the third noble truth said that ign ##oran ##ce can be overcome .
and then you do the ritual dances that em ##power the crosses .
they con ##sum ##e more coca leaves than any human population , half a pound per man , per day .
this little boy will never step outside of the sacred fields that sur ##round the men ' s hut for all that time , until he begins his journey of init ##iation .

today , we use a single feed ##stock , petroleum , to heat our homes , power our cars and make most of the materials you see around you .
the first is select ##ing a feed ##stock , pre ##fera ##bly something that ' s regional , that ' s in your area , right - - local manufacturing .
it actually takes a little longer . it takes five days .
good afternoon .
now of course , the moment that it does hit the outside environment , and its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree , it immediately turns back into normal matter .
but what seems so slow and grace ##ful from the outside is really more like chaos inside , because cells control their shape with a skeleton of rig ##id protein fiber ##s , and those fiber ##s are constantly falling apart .
as a test case , i propose we start with american dancers .
when they say to you , " what do you do ? " - - you say , " i ' m a stati ##stici ##an . "
you ' ve got to think , and i ' m going to ask you some questions .
so what you want to do is compare the average number of tos ##ses until we first see head - tail - head with the average number of tos ##ses until we first see head - tail - tail .
if it ' s a tail - - well , rather disa ##ppo ##inted ##ly , you put the glass ##es away and put the champagne back .
but it turns out that un ##lock ##ing the secrets in the information generated by modern experimental technologies , a key part of that has to do with fairly so ##phis ##tica ##ted - - you ' ll be relieve ##d to know that i do something useful in my day job , rather more so ##phis ##tica ##ted than the head - tail - head story - - but quite so ##phis ##tica ##ted computer modeling ##s and mathematical modeling ##s and modern statistical techniques .
so a natural answer is 99 percent .
one explanation is that the person doesn ' t have the disease - - that ' s over ##w ##hel ##ming ##ly likely , if you pick someone at random - - but the test gets it wrong , which is unlikely .
it might well be that there are environmental factors that we ' re not aware of , and it ' s pretty likely to be the case that there are genetic factors we ' re not aware of .
it has to do with wei ##ghing up the strength of the other evidence against her and the statistical evidence .
that ' s what engineers do . "
well , a couple of friends and i figure ##d out how to do this .
there are 10 billion electrical out ##lets in north america alone .
and now , today i want to tell you my personal observation in the past several years , from that wall .
on the one hand , he wants to sati ##sf ##y people ' s need of a social network , which is very important ; people really love social network ##ing .
and later this year , the rail minister was sack ##ed and sentenced to jail for 10 years .
at the comment ##ing area , [ it makes ] the chinese wei ##bo more like facebook , rather than the original twitter .
for example , you can ' t post the name of the president , hu jin ##tao , and also you can ' t post the city of chong ##qing , the name , and until recently , you can ' t search the sur ##name of top leaders .
so they want an ex ##cus ##e - - public opinion is a very good ex ##cus ##e to pun ##ish him .
whatever the future is , we should fight against the [ cat ] .
it ' s acoustic vi ##bra ##tions in the air , little waves of energy in the air that ti ##ck ##le our ear ##dru ##m .
now hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss has really evolved in the past 200 years .
girl : holly .
so if we had to design a perfect coc ##hle ##ar imp ##lant , what we would try to do is target it to be able to allow music transmission .
coc ##hle ##ar imp ##lant users cannot tell the difference between these instruments .
what that suggests is that , even in the case of hearing loss , the capacity for music remains .
he is now a medical student at yale university , and he ' s contem ##pla ##ting a surgical career - - one of the first deaf individuals to consider a career in surgery .
when i look around this ted ##xa ##ms ##ter ##dam venue , i see a very special audience .

when he aimed , he never missed .
despite the pictures we are shown daily in the news , wars between developed countries are no longer common ##place .
the armed forces implement the state mono ##poly on violence .
i hope you will respect my soldiers , this soldier with this gun .
and the interesting thing is that if you change the sequence , you change the three - dimensional fold ##ing .
we want to be able to build technological artifacts that are maybe good for the world . we want to learn how to build biological artifacts , like people and whale ##s and trees .
and then what happens ?
women are much more in balance because they don ' t have that idea that they ' re going to be able to do 100 pull - ups .
but we do have the potential to overcome disease and poverty , and i ' m going to talk about those issues , if we have the will .
i ' m going to show you just a few examples of how per ##vasi ##ve this phenomena is .
there ' s a basic , prof ##oun ##d acceleration of this evolutionary process .
i mean , you ' d think this is the result of some tablet ##op experiment , but this is the result of worldwide chao ##tic behavior - - countries acc ##using each other of dum ##ping products , ip ##os , bank ##rupt ##cies , marketing programs .
we ' re understanding the software programs that make our body run .
these are some designs from eric dre ##x ##ler ' s book - - which we ' re now showing are fe ##asi ##ble with super - computing simulation ##s , where actually there are scientists building molecule - scale robots .
doug hof ##stadt ##er wonder ##s , well , maybe our intelligence just isn ' t great enough to understand our intelligence , and if we were smart ##er , well , then our brain ##s would be that much more complicated , and we ' d never catch up to it .
computers will combine the sub ##tle pan - recognition powers of human intelligence with ways in which machines are already superior , in terms of doing anal ##yti ##c thinking , remember ##ing billion ##s of facts accurate ##ly .
inventor , entrepreneur and vision ##ary ray kurz ##wei ##l explains in abundant , ground ##ed detail why , by the 2020 ##s , we will have reverse - engineer ##ed the human brain and nano ##bot ##s will be operating your consciousness .
so like fox mulder on " x - files , " who wants to believe in ufo ##s ? well , we all do , and the reason for that is because we have a belief engine in our brain ##s .
you ' ve been taken out of the gene pool .
because there ' s nothing in this . well , allegedly there ' s nothing .
an increase of do ##pa ##mine caused subjects to see more patterns than those that did not receive the do ##pa ##mine .

some con ##sp ##ira ##cies really are true .
and this is test on some lip bal ##ms that we have over here .
i love trees , and i ' m very lucky , because we live near a wonderful arbor ##etum , and sunday ##s , usually , i ' d go there with my wife and now , with my four - year - old , and we ' d climb in the trees , we ' d play hide and seek .
but later the government soldiers began mist ##rea ##ting us a lot .
but this , sure ##ly , who ##ever that man is , whatever he ' s done , this is cruel and unusual punishment .
so the question is , how do they deal with this material ?
what we ' re going to do now is shade the sun with a board and then move the sun with a mirror to a completely different position .
every now and then , when they climb on top of the ball , they wi ##pe their face .
so this is called stil ##ting . it ' s a thermal behavior that you and i do if we cross the beach , we jump onto a to ##wel , somebody has this to ##wel - - " sorry , i ' ve jump ##ed onto your to ##wel . " - - and then you sc ##utt ##le across onto somebody else ' s to ##wel , and that way you don ' t burn your feet .
so here ' s our cun ##ning experiment ##er .
it ' s about an 8 - foot - long tube of metal , it ' s got a hundred or so holes on top , on that side is the speaker , and here is some lab tu ##bing , and it ' s connected to this tank of prop ##ane .
you see the skate ##rs often trick in this direction . the obstacles are easier .
sometimes you get a little star app ##laus ##e , and then i think even bill gates takes a nervous breath , and the talk begins .

it is , arg ##ua ##bly , the most au ##da ##cious ende ##avo ##r of that edward ##ian golden age of exploration , and it seemed to me high time , given everything we have figure ##d out in the century since from sc ##ur ##vy to solar panels , that it was high time someone had a go at finishing the job .
and so therefore , the entire purpose of a vc pitch is to convince them that you are the entrepreneur in whom they are going to in ##vest their money and make a lot of money in return .
and now along with that , along with the experience of starting an enterprise , or running something - - and it doesn ' t have to be a business .
there ' s never been an angel - or a venture - funded company where bad things didn ' t happen .
and then from there , you ' ve got to take them on a very solid , steady , up ##ward path , right from beginning to end .
" we have no competition . there ' s nobody else who ' s ever made a wi ##dge ##t like this . "
you ' re focusing on him ! this is steve jobs .
you do that , you give me your quick 15 - second or 30 - second intro , grab my attention .

by revolution , i mean a dra ##stic and far - reaching change in the way we think and be ##hav ##e - - the way we think and the way we be ##hav ##e .
last .
because it ' s shown the way we apply , generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context , which told us what in communis ##m ?
it ' s a cr ##ap system .
and you can say , " that ' s rid ##icu ##lou ##s , steve . what a dum ##b idea .

all of these things were made during the last 75 years .
my work actually took me through many countries , and showed me a great part of the world .
however , everybody in the factory spent his time at the art department .
so i was arrested quite early in stalin ' s pur ##ges , and spent 16 months in a russian prison .
this was bad ! man , i was - - i co ##ugh . i was sick .
idea about women .
obvious ##ly a really prof ##oun ##d moment , and it changed our lives in many ways .
we really felt like what we went in ex ##pect ##ing had nothing to do with what we were actually ex ##peri ##enci ##ng , and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight .
but what i felt towards the child at that moment was deep affect ##ion , but nothing like what i feel for him now , five years later .
you can ' t talk about how lonely having a baby can be .
and we were gra ##te ##ful that i was able to get pregnant , and i soon learned that we were having a boy , and then when i was five months , we learned that we had lost our child .
and i got about two - third ##s of the way through , and there was a chart on the right - hand side - - on the right - hand page - - that we ' ve label ##ed here " the most ter ##rif ##ying chart ima ##gina ##ble for a new parent . "
av : yeah , and then you have your first child , and then you really res ##ub ##mit yourself to these high ##s and low ##s - - the high ##s being the first steps , the first smile , your child reading to you for the first time - - the low ##s being , our house , any time from six to seven every night .
so the point of all this for us today is not just hope ##fully hon ##est ##y for the sake of hon ##est ##y , but a hope that by being more hon ##est and cand ##id about these experiences , that we can all collective ##ly bend that happiness basel ##ine up a little bit .
and , you know , it ' s a thing your piano teacher teach ##es you , but we never had a science behind these kinds of things .
and then you heard the original .
your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement , you know .
you want to hear it in different rooms and whatever .

we know our societies have to radical ##ly change .
and some are quite structural , like social impact bonds where you raise money to in ##vest in dive ##rti ##ng teenager ##s from crime or helping old people keep out of hospital , and you get paid back according to how successful your projects are .
then monarchy had seen off its big challenger , mass democracy , which was seen as a well - intention ##ed but doom ##ed experiment , just as capital ##ism has seen off socialism .
despite all of these similar ##ities , we see huge differences in savings behavior .
why ? because i have to consider that and i have to modi ##fy what i ' m saying to say , " it will rain , " or " it ' s going to rain . "
well , what i did with that was to access the linguistics literature .
the survey takes over a day .
it ' s current pleasure in exchange for future pain .
of course , from their grand ##pare ##nts and even their great - grand ##pare ##nts .
would he need the same language as a lawyer , for example ?
we need one today more than ever .

it turned out that giving the planes to the museum was worth much more than the debt , so for five years , six years , i only had to pay one third income tax .
and then , what population of the earth would be an equilibrium that could continue on , and be for 205 ##0 , 2100 , 215 ##0 ?

i got mad . brothers can fight . parents and children can fight .
the mother is the model of all alt ##rui ##sm for human beings , in spiritual traditions .
and so you see beings in their potential happiness .
and this is where you feel real comp ##ass ##ion for them .
so , practice comp ##ass ##ion , read the charter , disse ##minat ##e it and develop it within yourself .
but there ' s another class of simple things , which are also very important .
we have a lot of interesting information about what complexity is .
all of us , to some extent , study this thing called a bill gates .
now , if you like to represent this zero and one of binary , you need a device .
all right , let me then finish off with four general statements , an example and two ap ##hor ##ism ##s .
and i don ' t want to spend your time in going through the details , but in the lower right - hand corner , you see an example of the kind of thing that we have .
but it does make a point - - which is one which , in a sense , differenti ##ates the real world of people who make things , and the world of people who think about things , which is , there is an intellectual merit to asking : how do we make things as simple as we can , as cheap as we can , as functional as we can and as free ##ly inter ##con ##nec ##table as we can ?
so , they got the frames from these big bike ##s , put them together with the gear ##s from the racing bike ##s , got the brake ##s from motorcycle ##s , and sort of mixed and match ##ed various ingredients .
the ideas are coming back from the consumers , and they ' re often ahead of the producers .
that sounds like a winner ; we ' ll go with it . "
well , just imagine a world , for the moment , divided into two camps .
or the op - ed page , where if they knew the editor - - had been to school with him , sl ##ept with his wife - - they could write an article for the op - ed page .
and i was having dinner with this guy called timothy chan .
if you ' re a games company , and you ' ve got a million players in your game , you only need one percent of them to be co - developers , contributing ideas , and you ' ve got a development work ##force of 10 , 000 people .
this was a mother ' s day gift .
hundreds of remixes came back - - lots of different attempts .
and this is it , right , to feel and be felt .
recording : oka ##y , here ' s something .
and he said , " i ' m dressed as batman to hide my identity . "
one person sent me a very detailed description ; the other person didn ' t .
right now , it feels like i for ##got to turn the light on and things that looked so good yesterday are now shade ##s of gray and it seems like the world is spin ##ning while i ' m standing still or maybe i am spin ##ning i can ' t tell and then you say hey you ' re oka ##y you ' ll be fine just breath ##e and now the words sing hey you ' re oka ##y you ' ll be fine just breath ##e now everybody sings hey you ' re oka ##y you ' ll be fine just breath ##e hey you ' re oka ##y you ' ll be fine just breath ##e hey you ' re oka ##y you ' ll be fine just breath ##e thank you .
so there is the pattern that every one of them had , but they all were a little different too .
but then my mother said to me , " i hear you ' ve been going around talking about psycho ##pat ##hic killers .
but our grand ##ki ##ds are going to be kind of concerned here .
and we re - create the conditions that were present less than a billion ##th of a second after the universe began up to 600 million times a second inside that det ##ector - - immense numbers .
imagine a snow ##fla ##ke in your hand , and you look at it , and it ' s an inc ##redi ##bly complicated , beautiful object . but as you heat it up , it ' ll mel ##t into a pool of water , and you would be able to see that , actually , it was just made of h ##20 , water .
but what he meant was that what we ' ve done , really , is stamp collect there .
so all the ex ##quis ##itel ##y detailed calculation ##s we can do with that wonderful equation would ##n ' t be possible without an extra bit .
so that ' s one thing .
in about the first billion ##th of a second or so , the hi ##ggs field kick ##ed in , and the qua ##rk ##s and the gl ##uo ##ns and the electrons that make us up got mass .
and i ' m certainly looking forward with immense ex ##cite ##ment to it being turned on .
so from papua new guinea to hollywood all the way to modern art in beijing , we smile often , and you smile to express joy and satisfaction .
sm ##iling can help reduce the level of stress - en ##han ##cing hormone ##s like cort ##iso ##l , ad ##rena ##line and do ##pa ##mine , increase the level of mood - en ##han ##cing hormone ##s like end ##orp ##hin and reduce overall blood pressure .
but i told him no , i ' m sorry , compromis ##e in colors is gray , and we have enough gray to last us a lifetime .
and this was not a mis ##placed feeling .
we put the citizen first , and not the clerk ##s .
ef ##hari ##sto and kali ##nih ##ta .
people that were hung ##ry and hurt ##ing were signal ##ing their dis ##tres ##s , were signal ##ing their need for help .
technology is transformation ##al .
and not only is it em ##power ##ing to the communities , but really important ##ly , this information stay ##s in the community where it is needed to formula ##te long - term health police ##s .
half the city was dark because of a power cut , and i was living on the dark side .
but the story is not about these chapters .
your last job , your dinner reservation ##s from last year , your former friends , lie on a flat plain with today ' s friends , because the internet also archives , and it war ##ps the past .
for us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our wa ##king moments in it , the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost sim ##ulta ##neo ##us .
i wanted to learn to cook , and she kept me in the kitchen , cutting , cu ##bing and cho ##ppi ##ng for a whole month .
but if you ' re like me , my humanity is more like a window .
i was seven .
and then the next plant ##ing season , when they sang the dir ##ge , they would remove as many names of the dead that equal ##ed as many people that were born .
i cried for a very long time .
he was ob ##ses ##sed .
there are some of you in this room , amazing people , who offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity .
if you take a close - up of those , they look like this .
and if it is - - and particularly given the fact that we came very close to extinction .
so about 10 , 000 years ago by the black sea , we had one mutation in one gene which led to blue eyes .
three different options .
you can tag them with proteins that light up when you light them .
but one question you might want to ask is , are we seeing a rapid evolution of the brain and of how we process data ?
throughout human evolution , multiple versions of humans co - existed . could we be mid - upgrade now ? at ted ##xs ##um ##mit , juan enrique ##z sw ##eep ##s across time and space to bring us to the present moment - - and shows how technology is reveal ##ing evidence that suggests rapid evolution may be under way .
and when that happens there ' s moment that causes this robot to roll .
you can send them inside buildings like this as first respond ##ers to look for intr ##ude ##rs , maybe look for bio ##chemical lea ##ks , gas ##eous lea ##ks .
so the robot is obvious ##ly capable of ex ##ecu ##ting any curve traje ##ctor ##y .
so when we have a robot which is surrounded by nei ##gh ##bors - - and let ' s look at robot i and robot j - - what we want the robots to do is to monitor the separation between them as they fly in formation .
this is work done by quentin lindsey who ' s a graduate student .
and that ' s how it pop ##ulate ##s this map .
we ' re very co - evolved , because we depend on bees for poll ##ination and , even more recently , as an economic com ##mod ##ity .
there ' s a counter ##int ##uit ##ive trend that we notice ##d in these numbers . so let ' s look at the first metric here , over ##win ##tering survival .
it ' s 1968 , and we ' re pretty much covering asia .
it ' s like , " ug ##h , " so that ' s what we do .
i would like to encourage you to open your mind .
one is a super ##market standard : white bread , pre - package ##d , which i ' m told is called a wonder ##bre ##ad .
but we have , some ##how , in the course of the last few centuries , or even decades , started to cult ##ivat ##e an image of a myth ##ical , rural agricultural past .
and this is true , as you can see , for all countries , including the so - called developing countries .
the costs have been tre ##men ##dou ##s - - water pollution , all the things you know about , destruction of our habitats .
in fact we do not want this poor woman to work the land like this .
but yes there are some solutions .
i want to see fish pond ##s in parking lots and basement ##s .
we need to make them proud of being a farmer because they allow us to survive .
living with a physical disability isn ' t easy anywhere in the world , but if you live in a country like the united states , there ' s certain app ##urt ##enan ##ces available to you that do make life easier .
it ' s the person that ' s sl ##iding his hands up and down the lever ##s , so the mechanism itself can be very simple and composed of bicycle parts you can get anywhere in the world .
and then you can also engage the end user in the design process , and not just ask him what he needs , but ask him how he think ##s it can be achieved .
what my purpose of the talk today really is , is to sort of inde ##lib ##ly scar your minds with these char ##isma ##tic and maj ##esti ##c creatures .
and they didn ' t kill it . they called us to catch it .
and now the king cobra is a new one .
i mean , just incredible to see bun ##ches of ghar ##ial bas ##king on the river again .
and , you know , once a to ##xin is in the food chain everything is affected , including us .
so , people talk about political will .
rw : yes , this is actually the first time anyone of us knew about it , for one thing .
and it ' s not a diet .
now i thought , you know , if we just did good science , that would change medical practice . but , that was a little nai ##ve .
and yet , look at the number of pres ##cript ##ions that are being sold .
but the problem is , you get hung ##ry , so it ' s hard to keep it off .
it also helps reduce the risk of the most common cancer ##s like breast , prost ##ate and colon cancer .
when we looked at their psa levels - - which is a marker for prost ##ate cancer - - they got worse in the control group , but they actually got better in the experimental group , and these differences were highly significant .
it was a random ##ized control study published in the lance ##t .
bp : i was born old .
the human form , in particular the human head , has been considered the holy gra ##il of our industry .
and so , in 2004 , they commissioned us to do a screen test of benjamin .
and we also needed to make sure that we could take brad ' s idi ##os ##yn ##c ##rasi ##es , his little ti ##cs , the little sub ##tle ##ties that make him who he is and have that trans ##late through our process so that it appears in benjamin on the screen .
we started to look out in other fields .
this is when we ' re like , " ok , we ' re going to be ok , this is actually going to work . "
and because the life cast , or the bust - - the ma ##quette - - of benjamin was made from brad , we could trans ##pose the data of brad at 44 onto brad at 87 .
and then this is what we called the " dead head , " no reference to jerry garcia .
so , effectively we created a digital pu ##ppet that brad pitt could operate with his own face .
and the bear cubs were being harvest ##ed from across the country and being sold and traded .
and then it started , there was no turning back after that .
and the beautiful bears can of course live in the wild again .
we were in the desert , in wadi rum , in a small je ##ep .
so as we talk ##ed , richard and i , i said , " you know , maybe i should bring a camel .
but not a big - - for instance , in zebra ##s , they have a huge ear that ' s very mobile , so they can actually turn them both around .
you can actually see , right here , it will vi ##brate .
well , if poor old suk ##i is in search of a mate , what would suk ##i do to find the perfect mate ?
i ' m built to last .
and i think when you look at the animal kingdom , that is one of the most remarkable things .
when i was poet laureat ##e , there i go again - - i can ' t help it , it ' s true - - i created a poetry channel on delta airlines that lasted for a couple of years .
some days i put the people in their places at the table , bend their legs at the knee ##s , if they come with that feature , and fix them into the tiny wooden chair ##s .
the poem that ' s coming up is based on him trying to tell me a little something about a domestic point of et ##ique ##tte in country living that i had a very hard time , at first , processing .
i just have time to read a more recent poem to you .
and so it makes you wonder , what would happen if we had ##n ' t taste ##d the fruit of knowledge , so to speak , and what kind of morali ##ty would we have ?
the wolf is , after all , a very cooperative animal .
he takes basica ##lly everything .
and so what we do in the next step is we release one elephant before the other , and that elephant needs to be smart enough to stay there and wait and not pull at the rope - - because if he pull ##s at the rope , it disa ##ppe ##ars and the whole test is over .
humans ya ##wn when others ya ##wn .
in this case , we put two chim ##pan ##zee ##s side - by - side .
and so we found that the chim ##pan ##zee ##s do care about the well - being of somebody else - - especially , these are other members of their own group .
and that ' s what she does .
so let ' s watch a movement happen , start to finish , in under three minutes and disse ##ct some lessons from it .
so first , if you are the type , like the shirt ##less dancing guy that is standing alone , remember the importance of nur ##turing your first few followers as equal ##s so it ' s clearly about the movement , not you .
but i decided to learn about the bible and my heritage by actually diving in and trying to live it and immer ##se myself in it .
and my im ##mun ##ologist told me that i should also wi ##pe down all of the remote controls and iphone ##s in my house , because those are just org ##ies of ger ##ms .
without the sex part .
but i think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food .
so what we found was , when try ##pt ##op ##han was low , people were more likely to take revenge when they ' re treated un ##fair ##ly .
but i didn ' t find any .
sure , it is involved in positive emotions like love and comp ##ass ##ion , but it ' s also involved in tons of other processes , like memory , language , attention , even anger , dis ##gust and pain .
there ' s just one problem .
and perhaps one arch ##eo ##logist becomes an instant celebrity when she discovers - - buried in the hills somewhere in north america - - massive versions of these same symbols .
or maybe that big ?
so as i showed you , they ' re usually found on these seals that are very , very tiny .
now there ' s several thoughts . there ' s e . it could be i . it could be a , but certainly not b , c or d , right ?
we found that the indus script actually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts .
that ' s our next big challenge .
today , we can write a word such as ted in egyptian hier ##og ##ly ##phi ##cs and in cun ##ei ##form script , because both of these were dec ##ip ##here ##d in the 19th century .
and this is the space probe cassini pir ##oue ##tting through the ice rings of saturn .
using the very first telephone , watson was in fact dial ##ed into the heaven ##s .
a mysterious pers ##istent noise was dis ##rupt ##ing their research .
and as soon as they had laid all these , all their big stack of these jewel ##ed paras ##ols that they used to carry in ancient india , he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planeta ##rium , the wonder of the universe . everyone looked in that , and they saw in there the total inter ##con ##nec ##ted ##ness of all life in all universe ##s .
because that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone , each of us , and everyone else is different , then that puts us in an impossible situation , doesn ' t it ?
it ' s really too bor ##ing whether you feel like this or like that , or what , you know - - and the more you focus on how you feel , by the way , the worse it gets .
look at that beautiful thing chi ##ho showed us . she scar ##ed us with the lava man .
this is bir ##han , who was the ethiopian girl who launched live aid in the 1980s , 15 minutes away from death when she was rescue ##d , and that picture of her being rescue ##d is one that went round the world .
but it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful .
amy wine ##house said , " nelson mandela and i have a lot in common .
i have just been talking to the president of sierra leone .
so we have got to create in this world also institutions for peace ##kee ##ping and humanitarian aid , but also for reconstruction and security for some of the conflict - rid ##den states of the world .
so you go to the literature .
the foot is distributed along the whole leg .
not just with the traditional foot , but also the leg , and even of the body .
and where they have a problem with this kind of mes ##h , because they don ' t have spin ##es .
it ' s a secret . the animal effectively climb ##s by slip ##ping and look - - and doing , actually , ter ##rib ##ly , with respect to grab ##bing on the surface .
watch what happens when the foot goes onto your sandwich .
we discovered they work by inter ##mol ##ecu ##lar forces alone .
and here it is coming up at you , in its first steps up a wall .
so there ' s a clear message : whether you care about a fundamental , basic research of really interesting , bizarre , wonderful animals , or you want to build a search - and - rescue robot that can help you in an earthquake , or to save someone in a fire , or you care about medicine , we must preserve nature ' s designs .
this is a cal ##f in cap ##tivity making an im ##itation if you hum ##med this tune to your dog or cat and it hum ##med it back to you , you ou ##ght to be pretty surprise ##d .
as you can see at the top here , they share an up - sw ##eep , like " woo ##p , woo ##p , woo ##p . "
notice how few barrier ##s there are to movement across all of the oceans compared to land .
hum ##p ##backs , when they develop the ability to sing this song , they ' re listening to other whale ##s and modi ##fy ##ing what they sing based on what they ' re hearing , just like song birds or the dolphin w ##his ##tles i described .
but you can still hear that fai ##nt call .
i ' ll describe a couple strategies .
endangered whale ##s are killed every year by ship collision , and it ' s very important to try to reduce this .
at the same time , we need to be really creative in thinking of solutions to be able to help reduce these problems .
first , it enable ##s you to experience the universe : the worldwide telescope , for me , is a kind of magic car ##pet that let ##s you navi ##gate through the universe where you want to go .
it ' ll be a free download - - thank you , craig mundi ##e - - and it ' ll be available at the website worldwide ##teles ##cope . org , which is something new .
it ' s a social aw ##kwa ##rd ##ness like you ' re a stranger in a foreign land .
that means they ' re totally out of syn ##c in traditional classes , which are analog , static , interactive ##ly passive .
we have so much technology nowa ##days that these interface ##s should start conform ##ing to us .
this kind of technology is going to let even more people get into it , and i ' m really looking forward to intera ##cting with all you guys over the next few days and seeing how it can apply to your respective fields .
corruption ? poverty ? or is it something else ?
we want to go on with our daily life even though we are not living under normal circumstances .
recently - - this is a sensitive figure - - 35 public lynch ##ings have been recorded so far in 2010 in mexico .
with a thousand julian ##s working together , mexico would be a very different country .
this is a call so that every single thing we love about mexico - - the festivals , the markets , the restaurants , the cant ##inas , the te ##qui ##la , the maria ##chis , the serena ##des , the posada ##s , el gr ##ito , the day of the dead , san miguel , the joy , the passion for life , the fight and everything it means to be mexican - - doesn ' t disa ##ppe ##ar from this world .

why the hell should i learn this ? ok ?
and what do you dedicat ##e it to , in exploring a particular thing ?
i app ##rent ##ice ##d with a carpenter and learned about plu ##mb , square and level .
and the latest thing that i ' m working on - - - - is something really - - i don ' t know what it is yet .
and so thinking back , i was thinking those of us in silicon valley were really focused on products or objects - - certainly technological objects .
i have a few of them - - they ' re no more than a minute or a minute - and - a - half apie ##ce - - but i thought you might be interested in seeing some of our work over the last year , and how it respond ##s in video .
then when you exit the ima ##x theatre on the fourth floor - - mostly teenager ##s coming out of there - - there ' s this big open space that has these tables in it that have interactive games which are quite fun , also designed by dur ##rell [ bishop ] and andrew [ hir ##nia ##k ] of it ##ch .
and of course : a hamm ##ock for your afternoon nap that stretch ##es across your cubic ##le .
you watch the video with super ##im ##pose ##d graphics that indicate your depth and comp ##ass heading .
there is more of it than you think , actually .
a photo is not enough . "
the laws of physics : invisible , eternal , om ##ni ##pres ##ent , all - powerful .
and i said , " yes . " and he said , " why can ' t i ? "
i find that extraordinary , not to be able to see light , not to be able to see darkness .
" why are we here ? " and " what should we do about it while we are ?
this is extremely practical , but not so aw ##eso ##me .
so you have five million , that is , five million authors and five million plain ##tif ##fs is a massive lawsuit .
two row ##s from this table of two billion entries .
and it turns out that we can measure that very precise ##ly .
so that ' s sort of what we ex ##pect .
we have to make this available for people . "
and when that happens , that will transform the way we have to understand our past , our present and human culture .
but that ' s not all .
this is not tri ##via ##l .
or just try this one on for size .
and if we can teach listening in our schools , we can take our listening off that slip ##per ##y slope to that dangerous , scar ##y world that i talk ##ed about and move it to a place where everybody is con ##scio ##usly listening all the time - - or at least capable of doing it .
and meanwhile , i was touring locally and playing in night ##club ##s with my band , the dresden dolls .
i ' ve always been with my band or my crew .
and this starts happen ##ing all the time .
this is my kick ##star ##ter back ##er party in berlin .
well let me tell you , in terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year , because the arab spring is still spread ##ing , the euro ##zone has collapsed . . . what else ?
actually , that photo was past ##ed in a police station , and what you see on the ground are id cards of all the photos of people being track ##ed by the police .
kids just make photos in a class , the teacher receives them , they past ##e them on the school .
i do two things : i design mobile computers and i study brain ##s .
i thought the word framework was great .
one is - - the most basic one is - - people like to know things .
and it ' s a real shame . now why has this come about ?
and finally , some people say , well , you know , i don ' t feel like a bun ##ch of cells , you know . i ' m con ##scio ##us .
evolution ' s the same thing . we taught our kids , well , the bible says , you know , god created all these species , cats are cats , dogs are dogs , people are people , plants are plants , they don ' t change .
and that some ##how , prediction leads to intelligent behavior .
and in the future , when it sees something similar to that again , so in a similar environment , or the exact same environment , it ' ll play it back . it ' ll start playing it back .
door , door , door , you know , color , you know what i ' m saying .
then , if in that framework , you take a bun ##ch of theo ##reti ##cian ##s .
no doubt that it ' s going to happen , in my mind .
i ' m actually here to make a challenge to people .
just that little bit of money , which to me , i wish it was in my bank account - - it ' s not , but . . .
i spoke with aun ##g sun suu ky ##i a couple of days ago .
but if they were together plant ##ing trees for the environment , it was oka ##y - - creat ##ivity .
but it was the actions , together , of all of us that brought about that change .
today , in sweden and other rich countries , people are using so many different machines .
but when i lecture to environmental ##ly - concerned students , they tell me , " no , everybody in the world cannot have cars and wash ##ing machines . "
second , economic growth .
it ' s a real challenge in the future .
i would like to tell you a story connecting the notorious privacy incident involving adam and eve , and the remarkable shift in the boundaries between public and private which has occurred in the past 10 years .
do you see where i ' m going with this ?
discrimination was happen ##ing through social media for equally skill ##ed candidates .
we repeated the experiment with the same two groups , this time adding a delay between the time we told subjects how we would use their data and the time we actually started answer ##ing the questions .
they become aware . they achieve auto ##nomy .
i once - - this was years ago - - i saw ted kennedy and dan quay ##le meet in the well of the senate .
and it ' s led to a view of human nature that we ' re rational individuals who respond in straight ##for ##ward ways to ince ##nti ##ves , and it ' s led to ways of seeing the world where people try to use the ass ##umption ##s of physics to measure how human behavior is .
they have kids of their own , and they ' ve achieved a genetic miracle by marry ##ing beautiful people , so their grand ##mom ##s look like gertrude stein , their daughters looks like halle berry - - i don ' t know how they ' ve done that .
people with stroke ##s and lesion ##s in the emotion - processing parts of the brain are not super smart , they ' re actually sometimes quite help ##less .
but i think this research shows that the british en ##light ##en ##ment , or the scottish en ##light ##en ##ment , with david hume , adam smith , actually had a better handle on who we are - - that reason is often weak , our sentiments are strong , and our sentiments are often trust ##worthy .
nine ##ty - six percent of college students say they have above - average social skills .
but this is the source of innovation .
thank you .
and i tell you stories from there .
we are living among those men : they ' re our brothers , fathers , uncle ##s , cousins , all around us .
she works for a very big company , a workshop in hyderabad , making furniture ##s .
it ' s very fashion ##able to talk about human trafficking , in this fantastic a - c hall .
i ' m asking you , for these children , whose faces you see , they ' re no more .
just to let you know , i do not have a lex ##ico ##graphic ##al w ##his ##tle .
computers ! what about computers ?
so - - - - now , when you think about this , what we have here is a ham but ##t problem .
no . there will still be paper di ##ction ##aries .
you didn ' t break it . it ' s just in a new position , and that new position can be just as beautiful .
if we think of the dictionary as being the map of the english language , these bright spots are what we know about , and the dark spots are where we are in the dark .
because i ' m going to the internet , which is where everybody goes .
and we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language - - we can make it be the whole language .
the date was february 2000 .
we talk about this a lot , and i thought about trying to give an example of this . so , just one example : madame de gaulle , the wife of the french president , was famous ##ly asked once , " what do you most desire ? "
jeff bez ##os kind ##ly rem ##ark ##ed to me , " chris , ted is a really great conference .
i ' m in this for the long run , and i would be greatly honored and ex ##cite ##d if you ' ll come on this journey with me .
for one thing , gps doesn ' t work indoor ##s , and for another , they don ' t make devices quite this small , especially when those devices have to relay their measurements back over a network .
in fact , as i looked into her case , i discovered to my surprise that it ' s not clearly illegal for you or me to put a tracking device on someone else ' s car .
so let me show you how this works .
so something felt very wrong about the world .
we call ours ##el ##ves por ##s and rao , and we live and work in india .
this is a video prototype .
but as soon as they passed by , it would start to climb up the wall in jer ##ky fashion .
and once a creature pop ##s into our minds , it ' s almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move .
but we move to cities , toward the bright lights , and one of the things that is there that we want , besides jobs , is electricity .
likewise , with solar , especially here in california , we ' re discover ##ing that the 80 solar farm schemes that are going forward want to basica ##lly bull ##do ##ze 1 , 000 square miles of southern california desert .
so arg ##uing against , a man who ' s been at the nit ##ty , gr ##itt ##y heart of the energy debate and the climate change debate for years .
and this doesn ' t even account for the foot ##print on the ground .
over the ocean , it ' s not even land .
nuclear , the time lag alone will allow the arctic to mel ##t and other places to mel ##t more .
sol ##ving the world ' s problems can be done , if you really put your mind to it and use clean , rene ##wa ##ble energy .
thank you .
so each of you has really just a couple sentence ##s - - 30 seconds each to sum up .
shame ##less . shame ##less . shame ##less .
we explore for three reasons , the weak ##est of which is cur ##ios ##ity .
the shuttle is costi ##ng a billion dollars a launch .
100 bucks . that ' s the price - improvement curve that - - we need some breakthrough ##s in physics along the way , i ' ll grant you that .
we went - - i went to 100 , 200 ceo ##s , cm ##os .
when you want the taste that won ' t wei ##gh you down , the only way to go is up .
then , you ' ve got to , you know , face potential public rid ##icu ##le of - - that ' s a crazy idea , it ' ll never work .
nature ' s main process of creation , mor ##ph ##ogen ##esis , is the split ##ting of one cell into two cells .
i designed the process that generated the form .
and unlike traditional architecture , it ' s a single process that creates both the overall form and the micro ##sco ##pic surface detail .
it took me several months to design the column , but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calcul ##ate all of the 16 million faces .
there ' s that dip there for the 1918 fl ##u .
you wee ##d down through various steps that cause many of these to fail .
it ' s called hutchinson - gil ##ford pro ##geri ##a , and it is the most dramatic form of prema ##ture ag ##ing .
so i just want to say a couple more things about that particular story , and then try to generali ##ze how could we have stories of success all over the place for these diseases , as sam says , these 4 , 000 that are waiting for answers .
you probably know , if you ' ve been paying attention to some of the science literature that you can now take a skin cell and encourage it to become a liver cell or a heart cell or a kid ##ney cell or a brain cell for any of us .
if you don ' t believe me , just ask sam .
and for us young people , they ' re looking to become individuals and find their differences amongst themselves .
we ' re here , we ' re part of a community , sharing out ideas and discuss ##ing them .
this institution is government - backed and it has been the case for the past three decades .
use ##less .
my work is - - it ' s a reflection of myself .
at that age , obvious ##ly , i couldn ' t express it that way , but i told her i didn ' t feel right .
it became part of me .
and i looked at it beneath the micro ##scope . and some of it was flat .
so to cut the story short , i decided that i had to go back and do it .
can any ##body see the blade on the end of that need ##le ?
and i looked at it under ##nea ##th the micro ##scope .
i remember one time i was doing it , and the window was open .
i used a micro ##sco ##pic sha ##rd of diamond to actually car ##ve the actual base .
constructed each plan ##k of gold .
and these doctors or these masters , these spiritual masters of the sufi tradition , refer to teaching ##s and examples of our prophet that teach us where the source of our problems lies .
all we have to do is to get our ego ##s out of the way , get our ego ##tis ##m out of the way .
and these should also be the primary att ##rib ##utes of what it means to be human .
and one day i was exploring this cu ##l - de - sac hidden away a few streets away .
the next day i came to see him . i was like , " doctor , that was a really good joke . "
in arkansas they don ' t even ask . "
and jeff came up beside me and said , " so , have you ever been cow tip ##ping ? "
two weeks after my diagnosis , a bio ##psy confirmed i had a seven - inch ost ##eos ##ar ##com ##a in my left fem ##ur .
and i hung up the phone , and i put my face in my hands , and i scream ##ed this silent scream .
and one of the prof ##oun ##d things that happened was this act of actually connecting to all these people .
don ' t give in to the wall .
and every seven sets of seven years , the land gets an extra year of rest during which time all families are reunit ##ed and people surrounded with the ones they love .
so if you go to 23 ##and ##me , or if you go to council ##of ##dad ##s . com , you can click on a link .
ao : you did teach yourself to play , and as a consequence , playing the piano for you , derek , was a lot of kn ##uck ##les and karate cho ##ps , and even a bit of nose going on in there .
and hope ##fully we can show the audience now how it is you do what you do .
dp : " flight of the bu ##mble ##bee " on that note .
dp : he played " cho ##ps ##tic ##ks . " ao : and played " cho ##ps ##tic ##ks . "
this is known as the theme building ; that is its name for reasons that are still very mur ##ky .
does anyone know ? chi ?
they ' re fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that ' s clean , a world that isn ' t conta ##minat ##ed , a world that isn ' t poll ##uted .
and we use gs ##i - - geographic whatever it is , gs ##i - - to determine the range of the chim ##ps .
we now know that at gom ##be alone , there are nine different ways in which chim ##pan ##zee ##s use different objects for different purposes .
so , the sad thing is that these chim ##pan ##zee ##s - - who ' ve perhaps taught us , more than any other creature , a little hum ##ility - - are in the wild , disa ##ppe ##aring very fast .
the one thing we have , which makes us so different from chim ##pan ##zee ##s or other living creatures , is this so ##phis ##tica ##ted spoken language - - a language with which we can tell children about things that aren ' t here .
there ' s little bro ##chure ##s all around outside , and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future , i beg that you pick up that bro ##chure .
we want to go and spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their oral histories .
and i believe that a group like this can have a very major impact , not just because you can share technology with us , but because so many of you have children .
it ' s in your hands and my hands and those of our children .
so how do we do this ? well , we use a model system that we term a proto ##cel ##l .
it could run a meta ##bol ##ism on it .
it can sense its local environment and actually find resources in the environment to sus ##tain itself .
so since we can make some interesting proto ##cel ##ls that we like , interesting colors and interesting behavior ##s , and they ' re very easy to make , and they have interesting life ##like properties , perhaps these proto ##cel ##ls have something to tell us about the origin of life on the earth . perhaps these represent an easily accessible step , one of the first steps by which life got started on the early earth .
this is used in reference to a report in 2007 by the national research council in the united states , where ##in they tried to understand how we can look for life elsewhere in the universe , oka ##y , especially if that life is very different from life on earth . if we went to another planet and we thought there might be life there , how could we even recognize it as life ?
80 to 90 percent of their time was spent on five things .
the cu ##lmi ##nation of this is if you ' ve successfully raised your tad ##pole , ob ##ser ##ving the behavioral and developmental events , you will then go and introduce your tad ##pole to its names ##ake and discuss the evidence that you ' ve seen .
there ' s an old cell ##phone in there - - a good use for old cell ##phones - - which dial ##s the clinic , we go and pick up the mouse .
what the climate crisis has revealed to us is a secondary , more ins ##idio ##us and more per ##vasi ##ve crisis , which is the crisis of agency , which is what to do .
and then i sw ##ap it out with the students and actually re - release that carbon black .
and an early test which argument eli ##cite ##d cooperative behavior from the people below - - about a hundred to one decided that this was the argument that worked best on us .
in this case , instead of throwing che ##wing gum , or dor ##itos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish - - there ' s a body of water in iceland that i ' ve been dealing with that ' s in the middle of the city , and the largest pollution burden on it is not the road ##borne pollution , it ' s actually white bread from people feeding the fish and the birds .
did you know that today we maintain a global her ##d of 60 billion animals to provide our meat , dairy , eggs and leather goods ?
the animal could be a cow , lamb , or even something more exotic .
it need not look like this , which is actually the state of the art today .
he didn ' t write " little red lap ##top computer " or " little red dirt devil . "
and sequel truly is a real car .
we actually think the future ' s going to be event - driven .
and second ##ly , it ' s a fundamental business proposition .
so my mom said , " you ' re going on a bus an hour and a half away from where we live every day . "
he ' s like , " no , miss , i ' m not going .
animation , software , movie ##making software , they have it all .
when i was 15 years old , it was necessary for me to leave this place and go to a town a little bit bigger - - much bigger - - where i did the second part of secondary school .
you must stop . stop .
we worked with a lot of companies in brazil that put money into this project , the government .
i put the question - - three or four weeks ago , we saw in the newspapers millions of fish that die in norway .
we here inside the room , i believe that we have the same concern , and the model that we created in brazil , we can trans ##plant it here .
i ' d go to times square and i ' d look at the amazing ladies on the wall , and wonder why nobody is looking at the historical figures just behind them .
you can see the lis ##pena ##rd meadows drain ##ing down through here , through what is tribe ##ca now , and the beach ##es that come up from the battery , all the way to 42 ##nd st .
we know that there was a lena ##pe settlement down here by the collect pond .
and rapidly we started to reali ##ze that beaver ##s can be something that a bob ##cat needs .
and perhaps a black bear walked by . and maybe native americans were there .
and even though i ' ve only had a brief time to speak , i hope you app ##rec ##iate that mann ##aha ##tta was a very special place .
and , you know , built the society that we now live in .
and they may not want to live exactly like us .
and people who live in cities in the developed world tend to be very pro ##sper ##ous , and thus use a lot of stuff .
another thing that information technology let ##s us do is start figur ##ing out how to use less stuff by knowing , and by monitoring , the amount we ' re actually using .
most of those cites are growing inc ##redi ##bly quickly .
so one of the things that that ' s leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion .
so lula , he ' s full of problems , full of contra ##diction ##s , but one of the things that he ' s doing is , he is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international relations that completely shift ##s the balance from the standard sort of north - south dialogue into a whole new way of global collaboration .
here ' s a design for dis ##til ##ling water using sun ##light .
you know , that it ' s not just enough to survive .
so ##pa stands for the stop online pir ##acy act .
we do like to con ##sum ##e , but every time one of these new tools came along , it turned out we also like to produce and we like to share .
that is a side effect of their ordinary operation .
so this is the internet they have in mind .
they don ' t want legal distinction ##s between legal and illegal sharing .
it changed my life .
" what are you doing here ?
so the college works following the lifestyle and works ##ty ##le of maha ##tma gandhi .
we are the only ones who actually returned the award for $ 50 , 000 , because they didn ' t believe us , and we thought that they were actually casting asp ##ers ##ions on the bare ##foot architects of til ##onia .
but the people who fabrica ##ted that solar cooke ##r are women , ill ##iter ##ate women , who actually fabrica ##te the most so ##phis ##tica ##ted solar cooke ##r .
she has a cabinet , a minister of education , a minister for energy , a minister for health .
men are rest ##less , men are ambit ##ious , men are comp ##ul ##sive ##ly mobile , and they all want a certificate .
and they haven ' t collapsed .
i knew which woman i would like to take .
don ' t listen to the world bank , listen to the people on the ground .
our narrative here is real fm ##ri data that ' s map ##ped visual ##ly and sonic ##ally .
oxygen , hydrogen and zinc have their own signature .
and yet in two million years the human brain has nearly triple ##d in mass , going from the one - and - a - quarter pound brain of our anc ##esto ##r here , hab ##ilis , to the almost three - pound meat ##loa ##f that everybody here has between their ear ##s .
because the fact is that a year after losing the use of their legs , and a year after winning the lotto , lotte ##ry winners and para ##ple ##gic ##s are equally happy with their lives .
who are these characters who are so dam ##n happy ?
and then finally - - you know , the best of all possible worlds - - some of you recognize this young photo of pete best , who was the original drummer for the beatles , until they , you know , sent him out on an er ##rand and sn ##uck away and picked up ringo on a tour .
in this case , because the experiment i ' m going to tell you about uses them , these are monet prints .
we explained we would have number three mail ##ed to them .
it turns out that freedom - - the ability to make up your mind and change your mind - - is the friend of natural happiness , because it allows you to choose among all those deli ##cious futures and find the one that you would most enjoy .
so we gave them cameras ; they went around campus ; they took 12 pictures of their favorite professors and their dor ##m room and their dog , and all the other things they wanted to have harvard memories of .
they don ' t like their picture , and in fact even after the opportunity to sw ##ap has ex ##pi ##red , they still don ' t like their picture . why ?
thank you .
sometimes they just ex ##plo ##de before your eyes or come down super ##son ##ic .
i have a little cuban mother - - she ' s about that big .
" pap ##i , help . "
i was born in 19 - - i forget , and i came to this country with them in the aftermath of the cuban revolution .
and that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up to take her to have her hair dy ##ed , you know , that peculiar color of blue that matches her pol ##yes ##ter pan ##ts suit , you know , same color as the bui ##ck .
she gets into the car - - she ' s sitting on two phone books .
it ' ll help my breath ##ing . it ' ll do something for my pulse , maybe .
now , you have all been at a mall during the holidays , yes ?
by now , we have now cr ##aw ##led another four feet , and my mother finally says to me , " i knew it , i knew it .
we ' ll wait for the slow ones . ok .
" no , my daughter , she ' s coming in the bui ##ck .
people are watching us all around , " right ?
i almost miss it .
what zip ##car does is we park cars throughout dense urban areas for members to reserve , by the hour and by the day , instead of using their own car .
it required that it was completely tri ##via ##l : that it takes 30 seconds to reserve a car , go get it , drive it .
so again , we can see that price plays an eno ##rm ##ous role in people ' s willing ##ness to reduce their driving behavior .
these are also called mes ##h networks .
these are the next two lines in the movie .
and this open - source version means that it could be - - if we did a brilliant job of it - - it could be used around the world very quickly .
2006 was a great year .
and as these dark clouds were ci ##rc ##ling me , and i was finding it really , really difficult to think of anything good , i said to myself that i really needed a way to focus on the positive some ##how .
i ' d love to just talk about each one briefly .
so there was a time when it was your first time ever hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work .
so those are the three a ' s .
he ' s like , " do you know where morocco even is ? "
and that ' s the sad part .
tourist : i think that people are very fru ##strat ##ed that they ' re not able to get closer to see what ' s going on .
and i thought it was aston ##ishing to spec ##ulate , as if this were a competition , on something that was such a fresh wound .
dr : it was not an inclusive group .
so dealing with it is just an immediate master plan .
sort of like the spin ##al tap scene where you get the tiny little stone ##heng ##e , i gu ##ess ?
it ' s all inc ##redi ##bly hum ##ble material .
and i truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorte ##d out , that it ' s going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion .
those kinds of forms ?
so you can get kind of a feel for this .
but how about the kid on the left , or the athlete that leaves the field of play ?
let me tell you what i ' ve come up with .
how old it is ?
and today , we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition , at least to me , which is the following : to dood ##le officially means to da ##wd ##le , to dil ##ly dall ##y , to monkey around , to make meaning ##less marks , to do something of little value , substance or import , and - - my personal favorite - - to do nothing .
we think dood ##ling is something you do when you lose focus , but in reality , it is a pre ##em ##ptive measure to stop you from losing focus .
in 2002 , a group of treatment activists met to discuss the early development of the airplane .
treatment programs became possible , funding became available , and the number of people on anti ##ret ##rov ##iral drugs started to increase very rapidly .
so sure ##ly if a patent pool could be established to ram ##p up the production of military airplane ##s , we should be able to do something similar to tackle the hiv / aids epi ##dem ##ic .
the rule is about a 10 - year delay for a new product to go to market in developing countries , if at all .
what about athens ? mediterranean climate , but in the sun it was not comfort ##able . they didn ' t per ##cei ##ve comfort .
instead of blow ##ing a hurricane of chi ##lle ##d air through the stadium , we can use radia ##nt cool ##ing technologies , like a floor heat ##ing system where water pipes are embedded in the floor .
and i also hope that you share the idea that if engineers and designers can use all these different climat ##ic parameters , it will be possible to create really good and comfort ##able outdoor conditions , to change our thermal perception that we feel comfort ##able in an outdoor environment , and we can do that with the best passive design , but also using the energy source of the site in qatar which is the sun .
the main thing is a fix - it - locally culture , which is fantastic because it means that your product or your service doesn ' t have to go through a huge bureau ##c ##rati ##c system to get it fixed .
they are basica ##lly refer ##ral services , essentially .
so we are right now doing some systematic field tests to basica ##lly as ##cer ##tain whether something like this actually makes sense to the ash ##a worker .
and i started to see the world in a whole new way , like pairs of people connected to each other .
and , most important ##ly , what causes the clusters ?
and we thought this was a very interesting comment on america , and a kind of self - serving , " not my responsibility " kind of phenomenon .
i mean , there would be an advantage to ex ##peri ##enci ##ng our emotions inside , you know , anger or happiness .
so to in ##vo ##ke another meta ##ph ##or , if you imagine social networks as a kind of vast fabric of humanity - - i ' m connected to you and you to her , on out endless ##ly into the distance - - this fabric is actually like an old - fashion ##ed american qui ##lt , and it has patch ##es on it : happy and unha ##ppy patch ##es .
that ' s my social experience . "
they ' re both made of carbon , and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it that are arranged in one particular way - - on the left - - and you get graph ##ite , which is soft and dark .
you read about it in your newspapers .
the cdc recently conducted a survey where they asked respond ##ents simply to tell them whether they experienced significant psychological dis ##tres ##s in the previous week .
in our study , they are more positive , but they ' re also more likely than younger people to experience mixed emotions - - sad ##ness at the same time you experience happiness ; you know , that tear in the eye when you ' re sm ##iling at a friend .
we go on blind dates .
i mean , this is literally human beings with super - human strength and abilities .
we got mad ##d chad ##d , lil ' c , kid david and j smooth .
the l ##x ##d elect ##rif ##y the ted ##2010 stage with an emerging global street - dance culture , rev ##ved up by the internet . in a preview of jon chu ' s upcoming web series , this aston ##ishing troupe show off their super ##power ##s .
according to the treaty , those lands are a sovereign nation .
we had plans .
on december 29 ##th , u . s . troops surrounded a sioux en ##cam ##pm ##ent at wounded knee creek and massacre ##d chief big foot and 300 prisoners of war , using a new rapid - fire weapon that fired ex ##plo ##ding shells called a hot ##ch ##kis ##s gun .
2010 : statistics about native population today , more than a century after the massacre at wounded knee , reveal the legacy of colon ##ization , forced migration and treaty violation ##s .
those events led to a domino effect that has yet to end .
so , that ' s really the goal of my talk , is to a , commun ##icate that moment to you and b , have you leave this session a little dum ##ber than when you entered .
many of these deaths were completely prevent ##able , and this what i want to think of as the disco ##ncer ##ting thing , what i want to call " the last mile " problem .
inter ##cro ##ppi ##ng . inter ##cro ##ppi ##ng really increases income .
so , here are these women . they ' ve seen their parents have struggled with dia ##rr ##hea , they ' ve struggled with dia ##rr ##hea , they ' ve seen lots of deaths . how do they answer this question ?
so , somebody out there says , " five . "
almost out of kindergarten .
they are saying , " this is 35 miles per gallo ##n . i ' m going to do the environmental ##ly right thing , i ' m going to buy the pri ##us , 50 miles per gallo ##n . "
now , this is an example of that battle , and makes us reali ##ze intentions don ' t always trans ##late into action , and so one of the fundamental challenges is how we would actually do that . ok ?
this isn ' t about the biology of people ; this is now about the brain ##s , the psychology of people , and innovation needs to continue all the way through the last mile .
the care ##ful testing , rete ##stin ##g , design , are going to open up vistas of understanding , complex ##ities , difficult things .
macarthur winner send ##hil mull ##aina ##tha ##n uses the lens of behavioral economics to study a trick ##y set of social problems - - those we know how to solve , but don ' t . we know how to reduce child deaths due to dia ##rr ##hea , how to prevent diabetes - related blind ##ness and how to implement solar - cell technology . . . yet some ##how , we don ' t or can ' t . why ?
right , the current wants to run through the play - doug ##h , not through that led .
so i would encourage you all to grab some play - do ##h , grab some salt , grab some sugar and start playing .
and a friend of mine in austria felt so sorry for me that he talk ##ed the largest casino owner in linz into lett ##ing us wr ##ap his building .
but i will demonstrate different ways to get rid of difficulties and go to the point , to find an answer probably much quick ##er than arthur did . so , first , we viola ##te the common sense , the logic . all of you , if you hold your hand like this , 90 degrees - - all of you . not you .
now , i need an assistant .
that ' s a challenge . i like this .
so here i have , actually - - i know exactly where the cards are .
and if you work with , in the right atmosphere , with humor , you have - - that ' s the pass ##word to the cosmic bank of knowledge , where you can find any solution of any problem .
and then , i will demonstrate a thing from russian satellite , steal ##en - - stolen , probably copie ##d from america but we will see .
when i lift the he ##ap , i pe ##ek .
we do it again .
this is a kind of optical deal , right ?
now - - - - one guy lau ##ghed . so now , to find the queen , do it this way : take back the other one , take back the queen .
king of spa ##des .
do with both hands , and quick . yes , good , good .
right ? good .
two - - and it was two of spa ##des , right ?
yes ? zoe : yeah .
king of diamonds . lg : ah !
now , what happened was not maybe what you thought , which is , he suddenly became passion ##ate , engaged , involved , got a new teacher , he hit pub ##ert ##y , or whatever it is .
and your children are playing instruments .
the tone - deaf people , they ' re no longer here .
now , it goes down to a . now to g . and then to f .
and then finally . . .
finally , i said , " why am i cl ##ap ##ping ? "
he depends , for his power , on his ability to make other people powerful .
unfortunately , it was the last thing she ever said to him , because she never saw him again . he did not survive .
some of you might have seen this before .
it ' s a nice motiv ##ator .
so gluck ##sberg did another experiment similar to this where he presented the problem in a slightly different way , like this up here . oka ##y ?
the rules are mys ##tif ##ying .
what happens ?
these are the building blocks of an entirely new operating system for our businesses .
it ' s pretty . it ' s not bad . it ' s a huge trademark violation , but it ' s pretty cle ##ver .
do it for fun . no one gets paid a cent , or a euro or a yen .
so , it can balance on a point .
so here is the earth . it ' s a little less than a millimeter that was turned of solid bronze .
this is another species of work that i do .
and the idea that you could see things inside of a crystal ball and pred ##ic ##t the future - - or a television set , where it ' s sort of like a magic box where anything can appear .
it ' s completely silent and non ##pol ##lut ##ing .
the real social innovation i want to talk about involves charity .
you know , you want to make 50 million dollars selling violent video games to kids , go for it .
charitable giving has remained stuck , in the u . s . , at two percent of gdp ever since we started measuring it in the 1970s .
well , like most fan ##atica ##l dogma in america , these ideas come from old pur ##itan beliefs .
within nine years , we had multi ##pli ##ed that 1 , 982 times into 108 million dollars after all ex ##penses for aids services .
but if we could move charitable giving from two percent of gdp up just one step to three percent of gdp , by in ##vesti ##ng in that growth , that would be an extra 150 billion dollars a year in contributions , and if that money could go dis ##pro ##port ##iona ##tely to health and human services char ##ities , because those were the ones we encouraged to in ##vest in their growth , that would represent a trip ##ling of contributions to that sector .
and suddenly , out of the chaos , order .
you know , audiences like you , yeah , make the event .
can we have a little demonstration ? would you be my orchestra for a second ?
and our joy of music , etc . , etc . . . . "
and then like kara ##jan . let ' s see what happens . oka ##y ?
meaning that you know you have no authority to change anything .
this is very ex ##citi ##ng for those players .
rather enjoy ##ing what the solo ##ist is doing .
you know why ? because the meaning of the music is pain .
but all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sus ##tain ##ability means basica ##lly looking at the global ##ized economic growth model , and mode ##rating what comes in at one end , and mode ##rating the output ##s at the other end .
but are we to assume that the same brill ##iance and creat ##ivity and ada ##pta ##bility that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place is some ##how mysterious ##ly going to eva ##pora ##te when we have to design a creative way back down the other side ?
and in terms of climate change , is something that is not actually fe ##asi ##ble .
it learns very much from its mistake ##s .
so it started out with some work i was involved in in ireland , where i was teaching , and has since spread .
from three years ago , it just being an idea , this has become something that has viral ##ly sw ##ept around the world .
well , this is about state budget ##s .
there are various things in here : i could say we might raise more revenue , or medical innovation will make the spending even higher .
is anyone paying attention to some of the things these guys do ?
and unfortunately , as you get into that , people get confused and think , well maybe you think that ' s oka ##y .
so what do we need to do ?
it allows us to do the art , the bio ##technology , the software and all those magic things .
and after two more years of studying music , i decided to shoot for the impossible before taking the mca ##t and apply ##ing to medical school like a good indian son to become the next dr . gupta .
ke ##ats himself had also given up a career in medicine to pursue poetry , but he died when he was a year older than me .
anyone living in that house can tell the time just by the sm ##ell .
these people i still do hang out with .
all right , next .
don ' t they just pop into your head ?
it ' s amazing . it ' s a wonderful moment .
had he shown his father , " my boy has finally lost it , " he would ' ve thought .
the french writer michel tour ##nier has a famous saying .
and i explained , " it ' s a dark night and a crow is per ##ching on a branch . "
yes , it means i didn ' t have to draw g ##ye ##ong ##hoe ##ru .
we become di ##cta ##tors with a remote and start to critici ##ze the people on tv .
i walk around and encourage them , " come on , come on ! " they have to write like crazy for an hour or two .
art is the ultimate goal .
only those three words and she left the airport . that ' s it .
british phys ##ici ##st john ty ##ndal ##l , in the 1850 ' s , made laboratory measurements of the infrared radiation , which is heat .
i had been using the first line of the nasa mission statement , " to understand and protect the home planet , " to just ##ify my talks .
climate change den ##iers argue that the sun is the main cause of climate change .
met ##hane is also beginning to escape from the perm ##af ##rost .
it would be im ##mora ##l to leave these young people with a climate system spiral ##ing out of control .
the science is clear .
my favorite and a real hero of mine is yak ##ima can ##utt .
we can do bigger car stu ##nts than ever before now .
i sort of forget how bizarre some of those conversations are .
two stu ##nt guys doing what i consider to be a rather beni ##gn stu ##nt .
it ' s that shape because the helium has to expand .
it took me a while ; it took me years to find the right ball ##oon team to build the ball ##oon that would do this job .
i contacte ##d a company in the states who make suit ##s for nasa .
this is a very lightweight suit . it wei ##gh ##s about 15 pounds .
but if you are , and you say to somebody , you know , they say , " what do you do ? "
do you remember the story ? no , it was big .
in fact , we moved from stratford to los angeles .
why not ? i think this is rather important .
so the hierarchy is root ##ed on two ideas .
in fact , creat ##ivity - - which i define as the process of having original ideas that have value - - more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplina ##ry ways of seeing things .
i said , " what happened ? "
now is the time for us to lau ##gh at ours ##el ##ves , before others can lau ##gh with us .
so i retreat ##ed back to my cave and continued to support and produce comedy and let my friends use my co ##uch as a regional operations hub .
so every ##w ##here we went , we audition ##ed amateurs .
one : is the middle east being shown in a current time and correct context ?
early detection , early intervention , that ' s the story for these success ##es .
fifty percent will have ons ##et by age 14 , 75 percent by age 24 , a picture that is very different than what one would see if you ' re talking about cancer or heart disease , diabetes , hyper ##tens ##ion - - most of the major illness ##es that we think about as being sources of mor ##bid ##ity and mortality .
the important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these disorders , the one in five of us who struggle in some way , you find that there ' s a lot of variation in the way that the brain is wired , but there are some pred ##ic ##table patterns , and those patterns are risk factors for developing one of these disorders .
but this tells us how we need to think about it , and where we need to go .
how many children will you get ?
but how wrong it is .
it ' s very interesting . when we started our school the parents would give thumb ##print ##s in the attendance register .
there they met children who are with a different standard and a different minds ##et , a totally different society .
is it the exposure ? we have professors from mit , berkeley , stanford , indian institute of science who come and teach our children lots of scientific formula ##s , experiments , much beyond the classroom .
when i started pari ##k ##rma i began with a great deal of ar ##roga ##nce of transform ##ing the world .
now that sounds like an inc ##redi ##bly straight ##for ##ward question to answer , and that ' s what howard thought . because pep ##si told him , " look , we ' re working with a band between eight and 12 percent .
you should be looking for the perfect pep ##sis . "
every con ##cei ##vable way you can vary spa ##ghet ##ti sauce , he varied spa ##ghet ##ti sauce .
what howard did is he fundamental ##ly changed the way the food industry think ##s about making you happy .
much more vol ##ati ##le brown musta ##rd seed , some white wine , a nose hit , much more deli ##cate ar ##oma ##tics . and what do they do ?
and she serves it that way time and time again , and if you qua ##rre ##l with her , she will say , " you know what ? you ' re wrong ! this is the best way it ou ##ght to be in this restaurant . "
if i were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee - - a type of coffee , a br ##ew - - that made all of you happy , and then i asked you to rate that coffee , the average score in this room for coffee would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100 .
we have pre - cancer ##ous lesion ##s , which often don ' t turn into cancer .
if you develop a disease , you ' re off the island .
it was when i became a journalist that i really realized how i was part of this problem , and how we all are part of this problem .
so , dad graduated harvard in 1946 , married my mom , and bought a house in lexington , massachusetts , where the first shots were fired against the british in 1775 , although we didn ' t actually hit any of them until concord .
and , yeah , we can look back in retro ##sp ##ect and say , yeah , ha - ha , you know - - it ' s all micro ##film . but that ' s - - that ' s not the point . he understood the shape of the future .
and if you go on the diagonal , you get content and form - - and then beauty and truth .
so i wrote a book about this in ' 93 , but as i was finishing the book , i had to do a little bit of types ##etting , and i was tire ##d of going to my local copy shop to do it , so i bought a computer .
we could do circular narratives that were literally circular .
why is this important ?
now maybe that ' s been obvious to all of you for a long time , but for me , as often as i ' d encountered that exact difficulty on a daily basis , i had never seen the in ##herent challenge of communication in so crystal ##line a light .
and the key detail of this is that fe ##y ' s scripts were ##n ' t written by her and they were ##n ' t written by the snl writers .
because from what i can tell , the three things gay americans seem to want most are to join the military , get married and start a family .
but it ' s when you put all of these elements together - - when you get the viral appeal of a great joke with a powerful punch ##line that ' s craft ##ed from hon ##est ##y and integrity , it can have a real world impact at changing a conversation .
that is a lot of punch for 14 words .
how far back does that go ? how far back does modern language go ?
it reaches up to almost 5 , 000 pounds - - on a diet of je ##lly ##fish , primarily .
they school as adolescent ##s , and become behem ##oth lone ##rs as adults .
so the great thing about the mol ##a is that when we put the tag on them - - if you look up here - - that ' s streaming off , that ' s right where we put the tag .
and they come and give the mol ##as - - you can see they strike this funny little position that says , " i ' m not threat ##ening , but i need a massa ##ge . "
but also what ' s important is that they ' re not sla ##cker , la ##zy fish .
it was a 200 - foot diameter geo ##desi ##c sphere to be suspended over the east river in new york city , in full view of the united nations .
i ' ve got a little video to show you , but keep in mind that this is with no electronic control , and this is also with only four led ##s .
how does it feel to see someone like this come along taking your art and doing so much with it ?
he realized at once what had happened .
so , have we all become one - eyed - - two - eyed instead of one - eyed - - monkey ##s ?
and then aboriginal women in africa would come and say , " this is it ! "
i have a solution that requires neither machine , nor wood , nor cooking gas .
your parents were peaceful people .
hello governments of rich countries selling arms to governments of poor countries who can ' t even af ##ford to give them food .
her father the king said , " don ' t w ##his ##tle . "
" uh - hu ##h . . . " she said .
and leibniz was the first person to really talk about building such a machine .
von neumann , and a logic ##ian , and a math ##ema ##tician from the army put this together . then , they needed a place to build it .
so , there ' s 40 of these tubes , like a v - 40 engine running the memory .
" mania ##c reg ##ained its memory , when the power went off . " " machine or human ? "
this now is the third different output .
so he designed this universe , and ran it .
and it was his universe on punch cards .
and that ' s the end .
look at homi ##cide at the bottom , for god ' s sake .
i went to west virginia , the most un ##hea ##lt ##hy state in america .
you see , the thing is obe ##sity and diet - related disease doesn ' t just hurt the people that have it ; it ' s all of their friends , families , brothers , sisters .
now it ' s largely process ##ed and full of all sort ##s of add ##iti ##ves , extra ingredients , and you know the rest of the story .
normal . let ' s get on schools , something that i ' m fairly much a specialist in .
they have sci ##ssor ##s in the classroom , but kn ##ives and fork ##s ? no .
i want to talk about something so basic as milk .
this , all this bad news , is prevent ##able .
so , these guys are going to be part of the solution .
huntington ' s kitchen . huntington , where i made this program , you know , we ' ve got this prime - time program that hope ##fully will inspire people to really get on this change .
dy ##sle ##xi ##c , so i ' m a bit slow .
in fact , a friend of mine from the security industry told me the other day that there are two types of companies in the world : those that know they ' ve been hack ##ed , and those that don ' t .
they ' re completely anonymous , as it were .
and that challenge is : how do you do business , how do you trust somebody on the web who you want to do business with when you know that they ' re a criminal ?
now he developed his social and moral comp ##ass on the black sea port during the 1990s .
and this man with a planetary - sized brain is now serving a 13 - year sentence in california .
thank you very much for listening .
public health is another reason to consider retro ##fit ##ting .
and the market research , consumer research , asking the boom ##ers and gen y what it is they would like , what they would like to live in , tells us there is going to be a huge demand - - and we ' re already seeing it - - for more urban lifestyle ##s within suburb ##ia .
it ' s been so successful , they ' ve now taken over the strip across the street .
this one is one of my favorite ##s , bel ##mar .
you want to also try to get more system ##ic transformation .
the first is to plan retro ##fit ##ting much more system ##ically at the metropolitan scale .
but we ' ve got to get the architecture better .
so i decided to talk to women about their vag ##inas .
and she said things that really shock ##ed me about her vag ##ina - - that it was drie ##d - up and finished and dead - - and i was kind of shock ##ed .
and so in 1997 , i said , " let ' s get women together .
and i really love hearing about all these species at the bottom of the sea .
she went to juarez to take care of an ail ##ing aunt , and over the course of it , she began to discover what was happen ##ing to the murdered and disappeared women of juarez .
but , being a vag ##ina warrior , she kept going , and she kept com ##mitting herself to transform ##ing consciousness .
well , it seems to me that this hungarian presence in my life is difficult to account for , but ultimately i as ##c ##ribe it to an ad ##mira ##tion for people with a complex moral awareness , with a heritage of gui ##lt and defeat match ##ed by def ##iance and bra ##vado .
and then one day , it happened : he and his family were arrested and they were taken to a death house on the danube .
mr . tes ##zler hired 16 men : eight white , eight black .
and into the slow , second movement , marked " adagio religioso , " he incorporated the sounds of birds ##ong that he heard outside his window in what he knew would be his last spring ; he was ima ##gini ##ng a future for her in which he would play no part .
and it was only at that moment , as we were sitting down to dinner , that i recognized the eno ##rmi ##ty of the risk i had created , because to bring these two titans , these two masters of the universe together - - it was like introducing moth ##ra to godzilla over the sky ##line of tokyo .
and i - - no one else did , so i put up my hand , and i said , " it ' s a bac ##chan ##al by tit ##ian . "
and in about 1997 , the then - director philippe de monte ##bell ##o gave me the go - ahead to organize an exhibition for 2002 . we normally have these very long lead - in times .
and in this extraordinary setting , the costumes were like actors and actress ##es , or living sculptures .
i ' m working to try and break down that sense of that eli ##tis ##m .
but we take the severe ones , and we res ##ched ##ule the other ones the next day .
so we came up with these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mother also , [ during the ] time of [ the ] soviet union .
and really when you think [ you ] cannot do it , she will push you , and i can do it .
i ' m going to take you on a 16 - minute trip on 72 percent of the planet , so buck ##le up .
you know , we ' re going to do this , we ' re going to take it away from something else .
and like a living organi ##sm , you tear it open , it ble ##ed ##s its molte ##n blood , rises up to he ##al that wound from the as ##the ##nos ##phe ##re , harde ##ns , forms new tissue and moves lateral ##ly .
so , we came up with multiple hypothese ##s : there ' s little green people down there taking it ; there ' s all sort ##s of things going on .
we stu ##mble ##d on it , looking for some missing heat .
near that was met ##hane . i ' ve never seen volcano ##es of met ##hane .
fortuna ##tely , we ' ve been able to convince congress .
this is a remote center at the university of washington .
thank you very much .
let ' s talk about what ' s suddenly possible .
since we opened the website in february , we now have 640 , 000 students from 190 countries .
other students might be interested in a particular enric ##hmen ##t topic that they want to pursue individual ##ly .
in addition to multiple choice and the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video , we can also grade math , mathematical expressions as well as mathematical deriva ##tions .
which is not a level of service i have ever offered to my stanford students .
and finally , there was a population of students that were taught in a one - on - one instruction using a tutor .
you can see , for example , that the achievement score almost doubles in this particular experiment .
kaki king : playing " pink noise " on guitar
" learn the lingua franca . "
emily levine : richard . what did i say ?
i don ' t know if you know this but - - maybe it ' s different now , or maybe you were making a statement - - but in many hospital nurse ##ries across the country , until very recently any ##way , according to a book by jessica benjamin , the signs over the little boys cr ##ib ##s read , " i ' m a boy , " and the signs over the little girls cr ##ib ##s read , " it ' s a girl . " yeah .
so this whole subject - object thing has rele ##van ##ce to humor in this way .
and i was sort of , as i was starting to anal ##y ##ze what exactly it is that i do , i read a book called " trick ##ster makes this world , " by lewis hyde .
if they had had an olympics in martyr ##dom , my grandmother would have lost on purpose .
this is what i tend to see almost more than contra ##diction ##s .
and the mother is elderly .
and i like to explore all the pos ##si ##bilities in the hope that you ' ll be on the wave ##len ##gt ##h of your audience .
there are really serious cal ##ami ##ties stari ##ng us in the eye that we ' re in the same kind of den ##ial about that we were about terrorism , and what could ' ve happened on september 11 .
1995 , we found three . the count now is up to 80 - - we ' re finding about two or three a month .
it wasn ' t really a research report ; it was a sc ##ree ##d .
number seven : particle acc ##eler ##ator mis ##ha ##p .
now , corn originated , we think , in mexico .
we need to learn how to repair and rep ##leni ##sh the earth ' s oz ##one layer .
we ' ve all learned what - - the kind of panic that can occur when an old disease rear ##s its head , like ant ##hrax .
but galaxies are very violent places , and things can be sp ##un out of orbit .
of more concern , i think , is the asteroids that exist between mars and jupiter .
when the mission was over , they actually landed on the thing .
bas ##ho was a brilliant man .
and these two war against one another almost continuously .
all right , let ' s talk about another perspective on the importance of the oceans .
modeling : on the right hand side , there ' s a very complex computational model .
we are already lac ##ed up as if we ' re in a fiber op ##tic corse ##t , if you like .
this is going to be much more powerful than having a single ship in a single location , then move to a new location .
we pump the fluid through one of these systems , and we press the button , and it ' s anal ##y ##zed for the genom ##ic character .
so we can bring an entirely new tele ##pres ##ence to the world , throughout the ocean .
and i think that ' s really what architecture is based on .
and yet that energy and power of architecture has driven an entire social and political space that these buildings oc ##cupy .
it ' s like the old las vegas used to be .
our whole practice depends on computing .
and i do believe that this interaction with the history , with history that is often very difficult , to gra ##pp ##le with it , to create a position that is beyond our normal expectations and to create a critique .
so again , the unexpected which is also the raw .
and it ' s not only our memory , but those who remember us , which means that architecture is not mut ##e .
it ' s about creating with minimal means something which can not be repeated , cannot be sim ##ulated in any other sphere .
compromis ##e , if it ' s artistic , if it is able to cope with its strategies - - and there is my first sketch and the last rende ##ring - - it ' s not that far away .
that sort of overall sustainable energy problem is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century , independent of environmental concerns .
bruno bow ##den , who ' s here , did that , broke the world record . em : cong ##ratu ##lation ##s .
by the end of this year , you ' ll be able to drive from l . a . to new york just using the super ##char ##ger network , which charges at five times the rate of anything else .
what are you doing ?
you ' re kind of building a new type of distributed utility .
would humanity become a space - far ##ing civilization ?
it ' s much like on a jet .
these projects are so - - pay ##pal , solar ##city , tesla , space ##x , they ' re so spec ##ta ##cular ##ly different , they ' re such ambit ##ious projects at scale .
elo ##n mus ##k , i wish we had all day , but thank you so much for coming to ted .
i grew up her ##ding , looking after our livestock - - goat ##s , sheep and cattle .
because it was war ##time , the british . 303 rifle was just all over the whole country .
and thus , as people started feeling ownership over wildlife , wildlife numbers started coming back , and that ' s actually becoming a foundation for conservation in namibia .
the other partners that we have got is business communities .
in 2008 , conserva ##ncy generated 5 . 7 million dollars .
it allows for us to celebrate the sea ##fo ##od that we ' re also so fortuna ##te to eat .
well , how many bottle ##s is it before you tell me that i have a problem ?
so i think we have this whole eating thing wrong .
they got more calor ##ies over the course of a diversi ##fied mea ##l .
i remember well the mea ##ls of my childhood .
thank you .
and the great iron ##y and tragedy of our time is that a lot of the general public think ##s that science is still arg ##uing about that .
similarly , a lot of art projects stay in the art community , and i feel very much a responsibility through mechanisms like ted , and like our relationship with the obama white house , with the senate , with john kerry , to influence policy as much as possible with these pictures as well .
you see the glacier flowing in from the right , drop ##ping off into the sea , camera shooting every hour .
finally catch ##es up to itself , it advances .
all those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thick , just a gi ##ganti ##c dome that comes in from the coast and rises in the middle .
but what we have is a perception problem because not enough people really get it yet .
the more poli ##te ones said , " well , you know , indians make good software programmer ##s and account ##ants , but they can ' t do the creative stuff . "
they were working on truly global products , and companies like microsoft , google , astra ##zene ##ca , general electric , philips , have already answer ##ed in the af ##firma ##tive the question that from their bangalore and hyderabad r & amp ; d centers they are able to produce products and services for the world .
it ' s not a new product or a new process but a new way to organize work , and the most significant management innovation to come out of india , invented by the indian offs ##hor ##ing industry is what we call the global delivery model .
well , in 2010 , they decided they ' re not going to reveal this data any ##more , so i had to make some estimates based on various sources .
for a time that i find to be the most plac ##id and une ##vent ##ful hour of the day , four in the morning sure gets an aw ##ful lot of bad press - - across a lot of different media from a lot of big names .
100 years to the day after the death of alfred nobel himself .
and then - - three para ##graph ##s later we get this little beauty : " we went back to blair house to look at the speech for the last time .
let me first address a few popular mis ##con ##ception ##s .
and when that cellular space station is within the electric field , it acts on those highly charged proteins and align ##s them .
the expected five year survival is less than five percent .
and a year after that treatment , his tumor grew back with a vengeance .
i am the hap ##pies ##t , the hap ##pies ##t person in the world .
and i firm ##ly believe that in the next 10 years tumor treat ##ing fields will be a weapon available to doctors and patients for all of these most - difficult - to - treat solid tumor ##s .
and you can notice they have created a kind of false catch ##ment .
the age is 400 years .
we had full - page ad ##vert ##ise ##ments , some 30 years , 25 years ago when this canal came .
and it ' s a kind of water body for all seasons .
and they have dubbed this water as the third one called [ unclear ] .
three sides , such steps , on the fourth side there is a four - story building where you can organize such ted conferences any ##time .
these artifacts and designs are ins ##pi ##ring .
it doesn ' t matter if this is the jungle ##s of singapore or the tundra of northern finland .
and they ' re in ##vesti ##ng in telecom ##s , shopping mall ##s .
south africa is playing a role .
how do you get from poverty and corruption to wealth and less corruption ?
and then something happened in 1980 .
in ##vest .
but i think a much bigger problem with this is that this logic - - that we should be drop ##ping ipod ##s not bombs - - i mean , it would make a fas ##cina ##ting title for thomas friedman ' s new book .
instead of trying to pur ##ge these comments , they instead went and reached out to the blog ##gers .
right ? so they can go online and contribute ideas on what that region would look like by the year 2020 .
so what should we do about it ?
explain to me what ' s wrong .
no , the boy said to me - - the boy said to me , " it would destroy me . "
they called me anthony growing up as a kid .
we had a whole choice of ina ##pp ##rop ##riat ##e names for her .
the world i en ##vision for her - - how do i want men to be acting and be ##hav ##ing ?
soft power is a concept invented by a harvard academic , joseph nye , a friend of mine .
but sometimes it just sat there .
farmers now , who used to have to spend half a day of back ##break ##ing labor to find out if the market town was open , if the market was on , whether the product they ' d harvest ##ed could be sold , what price they ' d fet ##ch .
they had to sus ##pend functions at 8 : 30 .
and to this day remains the only jewish diaspora in the history of the jewish people , which has never encountered a single incident of anti - semi ##tis ##m .
it ' s the idea of an ever - ever - land , emerging from an ancient civilization , united by a shared history , but sustained , above all , by plural ##ist democracy .
trach ##oma is an infection of the eye due to dirt can leave you permanently blind .
and another key thing that i learned a lot throughout this whole process , last year google named me as one of the bright ##est young minds in the world .
so probably it doesn ' t matter 50 years from now - - str ##ept ##ococcus and stuff like that will be ram ##pant - - because we won ' t be here . but if we are - - we ' re going to need something to do with the bacteria .
mission accomplished !
there ' s nothing intr ##ins ##ically sweet about honey .
it ' s important that we love bab ##ies , and that we not be put off by , say , mess ##y dia ##pers .
and he like ##d to do an exercise with his students where he got them to take a piece of paper and draw the person who sat next to them , their nei ##gh ##bor , very quickly , just as quickly as they could .
maybe have the same kind of security to play .
thank you . all right .
so we have the finger blast ##ers . other people have dinosaurs , you know .
yeah , thought so . so we ' ve all seen it , haven ' t we ?
great . cool . so i was really interested in quant ##ity .
so it was a pretty successful evening .
construction play - - it ' s play ##ful , obvious ##ly , but also a powerful way to learn .
and of course , by the time you get to the average work ##place , maybe the best construction tool we have might be the post - it notes . it ' s pretty barre ##n .
we ' ve gone through lots of experiences in life , and they provide a strong int ##uit ##ion as to whether an interaction is going to work .
in short , we ad ##mire their willing ##ness to play .
perhaps in con ##ver ##gent mode we need to be more serious .
reaching success , i was pretty good at coming up with good ideas .
so they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better .
to be more accurate , i wanted to be a pop star .
i had learned to read music by then , or slowly learning to read music .
this is cheryl ang from singapore .
and i had the same reaction you did .
" my sister and i used to sing in choir ##s together constantly .
you can imagine , with 2 , 000 syn ##ch ##roni ##zed youtube videos , the rende ##r time is just at ##roci ##ous .
this here is nissan ' s my ##lea ##f , where your driving behavior is compared with the driving behavior of other people , so you can compete for who drives around the most fuel efficient ##ly .
they want us to fit in even better .
and that is an idea that , i think , that paul richard buchanan nice ##ly put in a recent essay where he said , " products are vi ##vid arguments about how we should live our lives . "
workers are treated as well or as badly as the workers were treated who built that chair . "
in fact , i use basica ##lly the same technology as this 14th - century classroom .
and i like that kind of response .
so what have we learned ?
so , a quick strike like that . and if we slow it down a bit , this is the man ##tis shri ##mp - - the same species - - recorded at 1 , 000 frames a second , played back at 15 frames per second .
i hope there aren ' t any snail rights activists around here .
it just looks like a saddle you ' d put on a horse .
in biological systems it ' s important not to have a whole lot of extra material requirements for building it .
the first peak , obvious ##ly , is the lim ##b hitting the load cell .
and these animals may very well be making use of not only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring , but the extreme ##s of the fluid dynamics . and they might actually be making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail .
biologi ##st sheila pate ##k talks about her work measuring the feeding strike of the man ##tis shri ##mp , one of the fastest movements in the animal world , using video cameras recording at 20 , 000 frames per second .
it turns out that something more than 94 percent of life on earth is aquatic .
now , go into the real atmosphere of this planet .
i put reverse th ##rust and i try and pull gent ##ly down .
i come back up , not for air .
so any ##body who wants to copy us and come and join us , go for it .
there are problems of se ##wag ##e over ##fl ##ow and conta ##mination , but i would also argue that almost every city has this exact condition , and it ' s a condition that we ' re all facing .
what is fu ##zz ##y rope , you ask ?
and the answer is : not yet , they ' re working .
we had to get rid of the sm ##ell .
and eventually snow made a map of the outbreak .
so that in one generation , we ' re going to halve our cultural diversity .
so , two months later , i went into tibet , and i started interview ##ing the people there , taking my photographs . that ' s what i do .
this is another leader of his people .
so it was a great experience for him . he stayed up all night with them , drum ##ming and dancing .
and just this last year we ' ve taken a group of teenager ##s in , and this has worked the best .
and so , i have my first slide to talk about the dawn ##ing of the universe and what i call the cosmic scene investigation , that is , looking at the re ##lic ##s of creation and inf ##er ##ring what happened at the beginning , and then following it up and trying to understand it .
and then i ' m going to show you it ' s actually a lot more complicated .
and then there ' s a part of the universe we can ' t see because it ' s so dense and so hot , light can ' t escape .
they go out and point a telescope at the sky , take a picture , identify what are stars and throw them away , look at the galaxies , estimate how far away they are , and plot them up .
and so now we ' re in for some serious play .
so we ' re zoom ##ing in .
so the question is , how hard would it be to asse ##mble this , right ?
that pull ##s in more material and pull ##s in more material .
at serious play 2008 , astro ##ph ##ysi ##cist george smo ##ot shows stu ##nning new images from deep - space surveys , and prod ##s us to pond ##er how the cosmos - - with its giant web ##s of dark matter and mysterious gap ##ing void ##s - - got built this way .
you get stress ##ed , you do some meditation .
we need an exercise . we need a framework to learn how to be more mind ##ful .
it does hurt . and we rein ##force the storyline , right ?
and he actually took one look at my sq ##ui ##gg ##ly line , and said , " well , why don ' t you just em ##bra ##ce the shake ? "
what if i could only create with a dollar ' s worth of supplies ?
it did not happen over ##night .
so i was filming .
and when i made my way to that pi ##ping chim ##ney i ' d seen in the distance , i saw hanna za ##vor ##ot ##nya , and i met her .
i have a deeper connection to my lap ##top than any bit of soil .
i em ##body the central paradox .
parents text and do email at breakfast and at dinner while their children comp ##lain about not having their parents ' full attention .
but what might feel just right for that middle - aged executive can be a problem for an adolescent who needs to develop face - to - face relationships .
that feeling that no one is listening to me is very important in our relationships with technology .
and we are vulnerable .
so what do we do ? we connect more and more .
make room for it .
let ' s talk about how we can use digital technology , the technology of our dreams , to make this life the life we can love .
the master said , ' tho ##u did ##st thy best , that is success . ' " from those things , and one other perhaps , i coin ##ed my own definition of success , which is : peace of mind atta ##ined only through self - satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you ' re capable .
i knew him once , but then he was a boy .
and that ' s not good , for a young married man to go home in a bad mood .
i think our tende ##ncy is to hope that things will turn out the way we want them to much of the time . but we don ' t do the things that are necessary to make those things become reality .
and you can win when you ' re out ##sco ##red .
i ' ve had some that could and would ##n ' t , and i ' ve had some that would and couldn ' t .
in fact , in the last 10 years , the number of patients requiring an organ has double ##d , while in the same time , the actual number of trans ##plant ##s has bare ##ly gone up .
liver cells , nerve cells , pan ##cre ##atic cells - - we still can ' t grow them even today .
we then place it in an ove ##n - like device , and we ' re able to create that structure and bring it out .
and then finally you ' re able to get that structure out .
that ' s actually the actual print ##er right now , and that ' s been printing this kid ##ney structure that you see here .
i became the captain of the team , and that was great .
i pulled them aside .
the other week , i went on one of these sites , appropriate ##ly called sw ##ap ##tree , and there were over 59 , 300 items that i could instant ##ly sw ##ap for my copy of " 24 . "
that ' s what happened to me when i notice ##d that we are moving from passive consumers to creator ##s , to highly enabled colla ##bora ##tors .
these four drivers are fu ##sing together and creating the big shift - - away from the 20th century , defined by hyper - consumption , towards the 21st century , defined by collaborative consumption .
these three systems are coming together , allowing people to share resources without sac ##rif ##ici ##ng their lifestyle ##s , or their cher ##ished personal freedom ##s .
this is fuel ##ing a massive shift from where usage trump ##s possessions - - or as kevin kelly , the editor of wired magazine , puts it , " where access is better than ownership . "
my name is joseph , a member of parliament in kenya .
the leader of the chiefs said , " no , sorry . we can ' t take you . you ' ll slow us down .
i ' m asking my friends from america to help with bringing nurse ##s or doctors to help us out .
so i was in the museum of science at the time the tornado hit , playing with the tornado display .
co : you got my number off the news ?
systems like the ones that we were creating on the fly could exist ahead of time .
mo : data .
in our hometown , we trained a half - dozen residents to run these web tools on their own .
and i met julius the last week that i was living in ki ##bera .
' in case you o ##we one month , the land ##lord will come with his hen ##ch ##men and bund ##le you out . he will con ##fis ##cate your things , ' armstrong said .
this is perhaps the most primitive shan ##ty that you can find in ki ##bera , little more than a stick - and - mud hut next to a gar ##bage he ##ap .
it ' s on very steep ground .
one is people need a gua ##rante ##e they won ' t be evi ##cted .
the future of these communities is in the people and in our ability to work with those people .
i don ' t know where julian morrow got that from .
see it up there ?
one is another american inventor ted hen ##ter .
many websites we can ' t read using ja ##ws and the other technologies .
i think i have to say goodbye now .
interesting ##ly enough , other neu ##rol ##ogi ##c diseases which affect very different parts of the brain also show tang ##les of mis ##fold ##ed protein , which suggests that the approach might be a general one , and might be used to cure many neu ##rol ##ogi ##c diseases , not just alzheimer ' s disease .
i ' m going to ign ##ore their cau ##tions and make one very specific fore ##cast .
so this is a time of great fl ##our ##ishing , and the more i look around , the more convinced i become that this quote , from the phys ##ici ##st freeman dy ##son , is not hyper ##bol ##e at all .
and to make them really stereo ##ty ##pica ##l , let ' s make them both white guys .
and if you find yourself wo ##rri ##ed that something like a gua ##rante ##ed income is going to sti ##fl ##e our drive to succeed and make us kind of comp ##lace ##nt , you might be interested to know that social mobility , one of the things we really pride ours ##el ##ves on in the united states , is now lower than it is in the northern european countries that have these very genero ##us social safety nets .
the reali ##ties of this new machine age and the change in the economy are becoming more widely known .
i have become more and more un ##com ##fort ##able with this perception of god over the years .
some have concluded that we can only believe in a god who shares our pain .
in the second verse comes the line , " the wind and waves obe ##y him . "
so who is god , if not the great pu ##ppet - master or the tribal protector ?
what if god is in things ?
how could one practice such a faith ?
and so , i want to kind of go through my little story of what i found out .
and if we study those hunter - gat ##here ##r tribes and the nea ##ndert ##hal , which are very similar to early man , we find out a very cur ##ious thing about this world without technology , and this is a kind of a curve of their average age .
it was sort of , in a certain sense , in a mc ##lu ##han sense , an external sto ##mach , in the sense that it was cooking food that we could not eat otherwise .
while this is something that comes from our mind , it also has its roots deeply into the cosmos .
it ' s a branch ##ing off from the human form .
i think that really leads nowhere .
that ' s what we get from technology all the time . that ' s why people leave villages and go into cities , is because they are always gravi ##tati ##ng towards increased choice ##s and pos ##si ##bilities .
meanwhile , i had grown up around a lot of teachers .
so the idea was that we would be working on whatever we ' re working on , at 2 : 30 p . m . the students flow in and you put down what you ' re doing , or you trade , or you work a little bit later or whatever it is .
that was just my one thing - - i said we had to have something that drops on people ' s heads .
and we found ours ##el ##ves full every day with kids .
the key thing is , even if you only have a couple of hours a month , those two hours shoulder - to - shoulder , next to one student , concentrated attention , shining this beam of light on their work , on their thoughts and their self - expression , is going to be absolute ##ly transforma ##tive , because so many of the students have not had that ever before .
they work under the teacher ' s guide , and it ' s all in one big room .
and so then they ' re all sold in the store . this is near the plan ##ks .
they didn ' t want to sell pirate supplies .
so this is the space during tutor ##ing hours .
any ##way . so i ' m going to jump ahead .
the schools need you . the teachers need you .
you see , i grew up in war - torn iraq , and i believe that there are two sides of wars and we ' ve only seen one side of it .
this is where we con ##cei ##ve of rape and casualties as ine ##vita ##bilities .
there is a side that fights , and there is a side that keeps the schools and the factories and the hospitals open .
a congo ##lese woman , who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them and saw her rape ##d in front of them and mut ##ila ##ted in front of them , and her children saw their nine - year - old si ##bling killed in front of them , how they ' re doing oka ##y right now .
za ##ina ##b sal ##bi : women , war ##time and the dream of peace
and she has this show , " the simple life . "
last month , i was at google , and , boy , that cafe ##teria , man .
and she ' s very important in my life , because she ' s the one that told me to leave mit and go to art school .
so if you compare complex ##ities to sim ##plici ##ty , it ' s also catch ##ing up in a way , too .
and when you ' re told this , you feel kind of weird .
so , i went back to the computer , and i bought five large fries , and sc ##anne ##d them all . and i was looking for some kind of food theme , and i wrote some software to automatically lay out french - fry images .
it ' s a bit ee ##rie , isn ' t it ?
this book i wrote because i want to figure out life .
and this is the fourth time , and i come here for this wisdom , i think .
environmental challenges fall into the same three categories , and most of what we think about are local environmental problems : air pollution , water pollution , hazard ##ous waste dum ##ps . but there are also regional environmental problems , like acid rain from the midwest to the northeast , and from western europe to the arctic , and from the midwest out the mississippi into the dead zone of the gulf of mexico .
you all know that . at the last ip ##cc summary , the scientists wanted to say , " how certain are you ? " they wanted to answer that " 99 percent . "
we have to have a unified view of how to go about this : the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions , all has a single , very simple solution .
what we need is another hero generation . those of us who are alive in the united states of america today especially , but also the rest of the world , have to some ##how understand that history has presented us with a choice - - just as jill [ bolt ##e ] taylor was figur ##ing out how to save her life while she was dis ##tra ##cted by the amazing experience that she was going through .
so they ' re saying the right things and they may - - which ##ever of them is elected - - may do the right thing , but let me tell you : when i came back from kyoto in 1997 , with a feeling of great happiness that we ' d gott ##en that breakthrough there , and then con ##fronte ##d the united states senate , only one out of 100 senators was willing to vote to con ##fir ##m , to rat ##ify that treaty . whatever the candidates say has to be laid alongside what the people say .
a change in commitment . a new sense of ur ##gen ##cy .
and this exhibition is about the work of designers that help us be more elas ##tic , and also of designers that really work on this elas ##tici ##ty as an opportunity . and one last thing is that it ' s not only designers , but it ' s also scientists .
he ' s thinking - - of course it ' s all a concept - - of in ##ject ##ing type ##face ##s into sp ##erm ##ato ##zoa , i don ' t know how to say it in english - - sp ##erm ##ata ##zoi - - in order to make them become - - to almost have a song or a whole poem written with every ej ##ac ##ulation .
in this particular case a section will be devoted to information design .
rapid manufacturing is a computer file sent directly from the computer to the manufacturing machine .
another shape is made for cancer .
and many designers have been working recently on the idea of death and mo ##ur ##ning , and what we can do about it today with new technologies .
we did it in three steps .
and the same pattern emerged in each conflict .
so what ' s going on ?
the opposite happened .
and within jewish teaching ##s , the rabbi ##nic teaching ##s , we have hill ##el , who taught that you should ##n ' t do to others what you don ' t like being done to yourself .
and then god looked to the future and realized , if the world was created just with justice , the world couldn ' t exist .
and that unity is something that connects all of creation .
and he rush ##ed home . and after the sabbath , he made 12 lo ##aves of bread , took them to the synagogue , went into the synagogue , opened the ark and said , " god , i don ' t know why you want this bread , but here you are . "
and he called the two of them to his office .
it pers ##ists for months and often ##times for years , and when that happens , it is its own disease .
but the worst part was , not the spo ##ntan ##eous pain that was there 24 hours a day .
we treat these patients in a rather cru ##de fashion at this point in time .
if you look out your window and you can see long ' s peak , you ' re probably familiar with it .
so it ' s about a mile across , 600 feet deep .
let me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosaur - killer for 65 million years . they ' re very rare .
now the good news is that the odds of it actually passing through this key ##hole and hitting us next go - around are one in a million , roughly - - very , very low odds , so i personally am not lying aw ##ake at night wo ##rry ##ing about this at all .
and there are a lot of other problems with that . it ' s very hard to do .
this probe actually can ' t use chemical rockets .
so i thought that it will be good to start with it .
and we all had all of that on tapes .
it ' s so obvious , straight in your face , and somebody must have thought of it .
you see banks - - i don ' t know if there are any banker ##s over here ; i apo ##logi ##ze in advance - - but it ' s the best job in the world .
just quickly on the results .
he goes and sees the governor . the governor says , boris nikola ##yev ##ich , i understand you are doing a great job , and you are the most respected newspaper in our district .
because when you think about the importance , some of the issues that we were talking about last night - - this last session we had about africa and his hy ##pot ##hetic ##al 50 billion dollars destine ##d for africa .
now we do day ##dre ##aming in 11 : 30 with 55 seconds left .
what happens to matter if you cho ##p it up very fine ?
and suppose they have , you know , very different sensor ##y app ##arat ##us , and so on .
and in a lot of familiar cases , they of course are .
it ' s a very simple example .
now , here is a very ex ##citi ##ng development that many people have not heard of .
it ' s the same theory of gravity .
pres ##uma ##bly , they mean something supernatural .
how true for lincoln .
so then he surprise ##d the nation with an upset victory for the presidency over three far more experienced , far more educated , far more celebrated rivals .
but even in his wilde ##st dreams , lincoln could never have imagine ##d how far his reputation would reach .
but it was not to be that simple .
a victor in a thousand contest ##s , three great civil rights laws , medica ##re , aid to education .
one of his favorite stories , for example , had to do with the revolutionary war hero , ethan allen .
and i was so ex ##cite ##d - - first person i ' d ever see outside of ebbe ##ts field .
but luck ##ily , my first confession - - to a baseball - loving priest !
and i want to begin with one episode from that sequence of events that most of you would be very familiar with , bel ##sha ##zza ##r ' s feast - - because we ' re talking about the iran - iraq war of 539 bc .
and what is the great king , the powerful king , the king of the four quarters of the world going to do ?
it was the largest empire the world had known until then .
no other evidence .
and equally , he ' d have been surprise ##d that he was acting under orders from mar ##duk .
they want to bor ##row the cyrus cylinder .
and i want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object figures .
and it ' s only when it goes wrong that we start to reali ##ze the importance of families to children .
for those without disa ##bilities , at age three , they ' re transferred to another institution , and at age seven , to yet another . seg ##rega ##ted according to age and gender , they are ar ##bit ##rar ##ily separated from their siblings , often without even a chance to say goodbye .
people need to know the harm that institutions cause to children , and the better alternatives that exist .
because it ' s obvious ##ly inc ##redi ##bly fri ##ght ##ening .
and that ' s why we wanted it to be the 21st of september as the date of peace .
and just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really em ##power ##ing actually .
it didn ' t matter if it didn ' t create a day of peace .
and i remember thinking , " this is exactly why , actually , we have to work even harder .
it was historical . could it work in afghanistan with unam ##a and who and civil society , etc . , etc . , etc . ?
and we did , and we traveled around , and we spoke to elders , we spoke to doctors , we spoke to nurse ##s , we held press conferences , we went out with soldiers , we sat down with isa ##f , we sat down with nato , we sat down with the u . k . government .
and we gave the film over .
ultimately , that ' s what it ' s about . "
it ' s about your constituencies ; it ' s about your businesses .
but let ' s play along .
so this to me became the important question to answer : how many neu ##rons does the human brain have , and how does that compare to other animals ?
compared to a rat , we might seem special , yes , but that ' s not a fair comparison to make , given that we know that we are not rode ##nts .
when you eat like a prima ##te , you can ' t af ##ford both .
and i think that ' s how we got to become human .
i ' m fas ##cina ##ted with the idea of what happens when you merge biology with technology , and i remember reading about this idea of being able to rep ##rog ##ram biology , in the future , away from disease and ag ##ing .
it ' s a very logical plan , but it was not always like this .
but one day , something happened .
the man , his name was mah ##mou ##d , and the child , whose name was raf ##i , left .
it ' s not a priority . "
the stu ##mp or cast prost ##hes ##is was made , and he was starting the real physical rehabilitation .
no need of staying with me all the day push ##ing my wheel ##cha ##ir . "
i don ' t want them to be tea ##sed at school by the other students . "
but with naj ##mu ##ddin , we cannot discuss .
they are 7 , 000 every year - - people coming for the first time .
this is my big wish .
i want to tell you some stories that explain my view .
their decisions , their actions matter .
what lessons would you take from an experience like this ?
and i was part of that .
now , i was a little scar ##ed because when you see those three problems , they seem really hard to deal with .
and he signs off , " thank you . "
it says a lot about her peer ##s who elected her .
can you see it ?
so when we want to learn whether a planet is habita ##ble , whether it might be amen ##able to life , we want to know not only how much total light it receives and how warm it is , but we want to know about its space weather - - this high - energy radiation , the uv and the x - rays that are created by its star and that bath ##e it in this bath of high - energy radiation .
wrong . i ' m not looking at you . i can ' t see you .
but there exists out there a very large population of people who will tell you that they have ps ##ych ##ic , magical powers that they can pred ##ic ##t the future , that they can make contact with the deceased .
she doesn ' t bring any useful information to us .
" did he ever have an electric raz ##or ? " " no . "
now , without that , how could we possibly function ?
she couldn ' t reach me . now she says she doesn ' t want to reach me because i ' m a god ##less person .
now folk ##s , this is not just a meta ##ph ##or i ' m going to give you now , it ' s true .
those are very important , critically important to us .
legendary sk ##ept ##ic james rand ##i takes a fatal dose of home ##opa ##thi ##c sleeping pil ##ls ons ##tage , kick ##ing off a sea ##ring 18 - minute indi ##ct ##ment of ir ##ration ##al beliefs . he throw ##s out a challenge to the world ' s ps ##ych ##ics : prove what you do is real , and i ' ll give you a million dollars .
so it runs frequently , the entire hospital , just on a generator .
there has to be something better . "
but this gives control to the provider , whether there ' s power or not , because they can ad ##jus ##t the flow based on the percentage of oxygen they see that they ' re giving their patient .
but we still want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can be putting into hospitals .
some logos designed by my students .
the creative spirit in africa , the creative tradition , is as pote ##nt as it has always been , if only designers could look within .
it ' s a holocaust of a different kind , and hiding under our desk ##s isn ' t going to help .
now , there ' s no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here , but the evidence is that plants - - and i want to make this clear - - it ' s not the ingredients in plants , it ' s the plants .
half the people who developed the food pyramid have ties to ag ##rib ##usi ##ness .
marga ##rine didn ' t exist .
the effects of this are well known . they are every ##w ##here .
most mom ##s cooke ##d like mine : a piece of bro ##ile ##d meat , a quickly made sala ##d with bottle ##d dress ##ing , can ##ned soup , can ##ned fruit sala ##d .
leading the way - - what ' s leading the way ?
and i say this as a man who has eat ##en a fair share of corn ##ed bee ##f in his life .
we can continue the search for the ingredients we love , and we can continue to spin ya ##rns about our favorite mea ##ls .
sound familiar ?
if i can ask an indi ##sc ##ree ##t question , how many of you have tatt ##oos ?
myth number two : or ##phe ##us , wonderful guy , char ##ming to be around , great partie ##r , great singer , lose ##s his belo ##ved , char ##ms his way into the underworld , only person to char ##m his way into the underworld , char ##ms the gods of the underworld , they release his beauty on the condition he never look at her until they ' re out .
some of these have already been touche ##d upon by other speakers , which is en ##cou ##rag ##ing .
52 million people die of natural causes each year correspond ##s , then , to 52 million volumes destroyed .
if we were to take into account future generations that will never come into existence if we blow ours ##el ##ves up , then the figure becomes astronomical .
we were very successful .
so if you think about what it means to learn ari ##th ##metic or to learn to read , you ' re actually , literally re ##writing your own brain .
and they would just stare at us with ba ##ffle ##ment when we spend time listening to a beautiful performance , like the one we just heard - - because of people making stu ##pid movements , and they would be really ir ##rita ##ted and would ##n ' t see what we were up to .
so then , you move off to this larger sphere of " human + , " and you could continue that process and eventually explore a lot of this larger space of possible modes of being .
ts : those are permanent magnet ##s , yeah .
ts : yeah , well let ' s put a couple of canvas ##es .
and then when i did the second one , it really dis ##tur ##bed the piece - - these big blue lines crash ##ing through the center of it - - and so it created a kind of tension and an over ##lap .
you know , it seems at this stage in your life , you also very personally are in this state of confrontation with a sort of disso ##nant - - i suppose it ' s an electro ##ma ##gnet ##ic force that some ##how govern ##s your parkinson ' s and this creative force that is both the artist who is in the here and now and this sort of arc of your whole life .
ts : thank you , john .
my mother comes out , and he asks her for money , but she doesn ' t have enough .
i grew up in the middle of nowhere on a dirt road in rural arkansas , an hour from the nearest movie theater .
one of them , i call my mim ##aw ' s test .
i ' m under the river with those fish .
one of these is scratch - off master ##piece ##s .
what he did was to get wild birds to make his art for him .
and so we got to the grave and made this , which was hil ##ario ##us - - the attention that we got .
and also they reference how the uv ##ula - - everything they say is fallen because of the forbidden fruit .
he ' s an australian aboriginal elder , and he ' s also an artist .
and you would think that should have nothing to do with one another , but i hope by the end of these 18 minutes , you ' ll see a little bit of a relation .
and what changed is something you might not have expected in an art , which is math .
and if you don ' t want to fold 400 scales , you can back off and just do a few things , and add plates to the back of a turtle , or toe ##s .
we ' re going to learn how to make one fl ##ap .
and i can use those patterns now to create ori ##gami shape ##s .
toe ##s have become an ori ##gami meme , because everyone ' s doing it .
they certainly didn ' t need to talk to ori ##gami artists .
the problem that ' s being solve ##d here is something that needs to be big and sheet - like at its destination , but needs to be small for the journey .
forrest north : the beginning of any collaboration starts with a conversation .
he came up with our name and logo . we ' re mission motors .
the 200 , 000 - year period in which men have been top dog is truly coming to an end , believe it or not , and that ' s why i talk about the " end of men . "
and so they decided , because they were intr ##igue ##d by this finding , to do a nationwide survey .
but that really isn ' t true any ##more .
and what ' s even more dis ##tur ##bing is what ' s happen ##ing with younger boys .
and i think the reason it has a sting is because thousands of years of history don ' t reverse themselves without a lot of pain , and that ' s why i talk about us all going through this together .
but over the ' 70 ##s and ' 80 ##s , the south korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrial ##ize , and so what they did was , they started to push women into the work ##force .
and we have a lot of skill and experience , but it ' s a trick , so how are you supposed to prepare to get through that glass ceiling ?
and the man who talk ##ed at that evening lecture was very interesting .
and it ' s interesting , if you think about it , how , when we think about the civilization ##s that we look up to as having been pin ##nac ##les of human achievement - - whether it ' s china , greece , the hindu civilization , or the maya ##s , or egyptian ##s - - what we know about them is really about their ec ##stas ##ies , not about their everyday life .
whether it ' s mathematics or music , it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it ' s better than what was there before .
you know that what you need to do is possible to do , even though difficult , and sense of time disa ##ppe ##ars , you forget yourself , you feel part of something larger .
even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow , but that ' s when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get feedback from it .
and if " where do you come from ? "
and the number of us who live outside the old nation - state categories is increasing so quickly , by 64 million just in the last 12 years , that soon there will be more of us than there are americans .
and yet , there is one great problem with movement , and that is that it ' s really hard to get your bearing ##s when you ' re in mida ##ir .
and i sat down , and i began to write , and write , and write , even though i ' d gone there really to get away from my desk .
thank you .
i ' m going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future , but i will not use digital technology , as i ' ve done during my first five ted ##tal ##ks .
and the most successful of the developing countries , they have moved on , you know , and they have become emerging economie ##s , we call them .
will they move on ?
the whole emerging world joins the western world with good child survival and small family size , but we still have the poore ##st billion .
the world ' s population will grow to 9 billion over the next 50 years - - and only by raising the living standards of the poore ##st can we check population growth . this is the paradox ##ical answer that hans roslin ##g un ##vei ##ls at ted @ cannes using color ##ful new data display technology .
we are left with this missing space of increased deaths the further north you go .
and i started doing research , and we found , very ex ##citi ##ng ##ly , that the skin produces nit ##ric oxide .
now , what we were care ##ful to do was , vitamin d is made by ultra ##vio ##let b rays and we wanted to separate our story from the vitamin d story .
there is no change in blood flow , in dila ##tation of the blood vessels .
and this is ongoing work , but der ##mat ##ologist ##s - - i mean , i ' m a der ##mat ##ologist .
these are major issues .
so , your body is constantly regen ##erat ##ing .
it dis ##inte ##gra ##tes a few months later .
and this is an x - ray showing you the patent , functional blood vessel .
but there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it .
another strategy that we have followed is actually to use dec ##ell ##ular ##ized organs .
we are limited with distances right now , but our goal is actually to increase those distances over time .
he finally stops the runaway stage .
i would be willing to bet that i ' m the dum ##bes ##t guy in the room because i couldn ' t get through school . i struggled with school .
what we do is we sit and teach our kids all the things they should ##n ' t do : don ' t hit ; don ' t bit ##e ; don ' t sw ##ear .
all three of the founders of nets ##cape had it .
is it thing one or thing two ? what is it ?
and i remember this one customer so vi ##vid ##ly because i also did some other stuff with these clients .
i also learned , don ' t reveal your source , because i got beat up after about four weeks of doing this because one of the rich kids found out where i was buying my comics from , and he didn ' t like the fact that he was paying a lot more .
and you could stuff pins in them .
then i would go up and deliver them to these 70 - year - old women playing bridge .
that was cool because then i had retail out ##lets .
and then they don ' t have a regular check , but they have more opportunities to find more stuff , and they learn the skill of nego ##tia ##ting , and they learn the skill of finding opportunities as well .
if you go into a restaurant and you have bad customer service , show them what bad customer service looks like .
it ' s a video that was done by one of the companies that i mentor .
we have even managed to make the study of literature arca ##ne .
a harr ##owi ##ng pred ##ile ##ction for the uses of force had become common ##place , with an equal dis ##tast ##e for the alternative forms of influence .
but structures designed to connect , rather than divide mutual ##ly dependent circles , rather than isola ##ting triangle ##s .
the most important discovery we made in our focus on public action was to app ##rec ##iate that the hard choice ##s are not between good and evil , but between competing goods .
president obama and his team simply cannot do it alone .
oka ##y , see ? it ' s done . it ' s almost done . here we go .
they recognize : both of these things have to live together .
they are acting in the sense that they ' re em ##ulat ##ing the original mas ##hu ##p .
in the good old days when this republican ran that company , their greatest work was work that built on the past , right .
now , i think there are lessons we should learn here , lessons about open ##ness .
you could still buy the music , but you couldn ' t hear anything because it had been silence ##d .
any ##way , please join me in teaching these values .
if you don ' t say the right creative thing , you ' re going to be judge ##d .
and something else happened , these people who went through the process and touche ##d the snake ended up having less an ##xie ##ty about other things in their lives .
about that time he was at the d . school at stanford taking classes .
so while you ' re sitting around with the other patients in your paj ##amas and everybody ' s pale and thin and you ' re waiting for your turn to get the gamma rays , you think of a lot of things .
thank you .
let ' s take a look at what ' s going on in different space types in this building .
when he met me and realized that it was possible for him to study in a quantitat ##ive way how his design choice ##s impact ##ed the ecology and biology of this building , he got really ex ##cite ##d , because it added a new dimension to what he did .
so let ' s just run through these guys .
the system was designed to aug ##ment human intelligence , it was called .
these are some examples of this system in action in the late 80 ##s .
and according to fortune magazine , he ' s worth 700 million dollars .
in fact , someone on red ##dit thought , " oh , what a great thing , we should all vote this up . "
they even created an e - card so you could send your friend a dancing sp ##lash ##y .
i am a native of burkina faso .
fund ##rais ##ing was not an easy task .
and for me and my community , this project was a huge success .
i would like to share with you this .
yes , you know it .
and when you look through them , you get a gli ##mps ##e into the mind of the cyber - illusion ##ist .
voice : don ' t tell , or it won ' t come true .
digital mt : this is without a question the real thing .
now the big question here is obvious ##ly , how do we make sense of china ?
the first is that the most important political value for the chinese is unity , is the maintenance of chinese civilization .
the chinese have a very , very different conception of race to most other countries .
it ' s had no serious rivals .
so there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is china - - the civilization - state , the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society .
first , the west is rapidly losing its influence in the world .
now this is the way things are going to move , because china has a very specific problem , which is different from europe and different from the united states : china has huge numbers of people and no space .
red = drums , blue = bass , green = chor ##ds , orange = leads , purple = pad ##s the mouth ##piece consists of . . .
it ' s been eight years , and i can tell you that i didn ' t go to china to become a lawyer .
[ chinese ] " big sister wong , " wash ##burn , wong , same difference .
what about art ?
everyone was gl ##ue ##d to the tv , watching dis ##tur ##bing , fri ##ght ##ening images taken from the edge of the neighborhood .
when we got there , we just went in the street , started talking with people every ##w ##here , and we realized that things were a bit different from the rh ##eto ##ric we heard in the media .
people come around us and start asking , " what are you doing here ? "
i just observed .
then the next day , i held a meeting on the main square and some women came .
we went to africa , sudan , sierra leone , liberia , kenya .
you know what i love is , for example , when you see the biggest eye there , there are so [ many ] houses inside .
for each project we do a film .
but yesterday the city called them and said , " look , you ' re going to have to tear it down .
actually the fact that art cannot change things makes it a neutral place for exchange ##s and discussions , and then enable ##s you to change the world .
and we come from a long tradition of sharing .
one of the founders went to switzerland , saw it implemented some ##place , said , " wow , that looks really cool .
the number across the u . s . and western europe is eight percent .
so here we have lu ##dot ##ruck , which is in l . a . , doing the things that go ##urm ##et food trucks do , and they ' ve gathered quite a following .
super fun , and it happens in a very transition ##al neighborhood .
the future , as we know it , is very un ##pre ##dic ##table .
we ' ve seen it in the financial crisis . we ' ve seen it in the pan ##dem ##ic fl ##u .
but will this only be available for the super rich , for those that can af ##ford it ? are we headed for a new eugen ##ics ?
an individual , for the first time in the history of humanity , will have the capacity , by 2030 , to destroy the planet , to wreck everything , through the creation , for example , of a bio ##pat ##hog ##en .
i ' m not on top of the class .
but , most important ##ly , while i was traveling , i taught children cartoon ##ing , and in exchange , i learned how to be spo ##ntan ##eous .
i was he ##sita ##nt to include this in my presentation because this cartoon was published soon after 9 / 11 .
everything had to be larger . the next painting was even bigger .
this is a work , a library i designed for the robin hood foundation .
so then i said , " nets , what do i do ? "
we had fashion designers , installation artists , models , we had makeup artists , jewel ##ry designers , all kinds of people working with me to make my wedding an art installation .
my works also turned auto ##bio ##graphic ##al .
you know i sat at home and i watched .
and i drew it out for her .
e : ach ##oo !
can you get down ?
because one of her favorite folk ##s from back home is here , and she ' s pretty nervous to meet him .
e : qua ##ck , qua ##ck , qua ##ck .
sw : you are very special . what would you like to say to all these nice people ?
and on one particular day , the camp ##ers were jumping through inner tubes , they were diving through inner tubes . and i thought this would be great fun .
i started seeking out tri ##ath ##letes because i found that life ##long swim ##mers often couldn ' t teach what they did .
the head is held in line with the spin ##e , so that you use strategic water pressure to raise your legs up - - very important , especially for people with lower body fat .
so i thought why not pun ##ish myself ? i ' ll do japanese .
and that set me on this panic driven search for the perfect language method .
and so i ended up walking like this .
i interviewed these people because they all taught in buenos aires .
that ' s just one benefit of that .
what i want to talk about today is one idea .
now not sur ##pris ##ingly , that influenced some people to think we were onto something .
geoff mu ##lgan : a short intro to the studio school
and the phil ##isti ##ne who is sent down , their mighty warrior , is a giant .
so david , in that story , is supposed to be the under ##dog , right ?
if you go back over the history of ancient warfare , you will find time and time again that sl ##inger ##s were the decisive factor against infantry in one kind of battle or another .
and then there ' s this whole weird thing about how long it takes goli ##ath to rea ##ct to the sight of david .
and that would also explain so much of what was strange about his behavior that day .
and something feste ##red inside me after this happened .
we have millions of genes of micro ##bes in our human micro ##bio ##me covering us .
and so , these studies have documented or suggested out of a variety of important functions for the micro ##bia ##l community , this cloud , the non - path ##ogen ##s that live in and on us .
we should treat it care ##fully and with respect , and we do not want to mess with it , say by c - sections or by anti ##bio ##tics or excessive clean ##lines ##s , without some real good just ##ification .
and that ' s what we ' re doing . so wikipedia - - you just saw the little demonstration of it - - it ' s a free ##ly licensed encyclopedia . it ' s written by thousands of volunteers all over the world in many , many languages .
and he ' s only been our employee since january 2005 , all the other growth before that .
the media has covered this somewhat extensively .
we should merely report on what rep ##uta ##ble parties have said about it .
these are the people who are doing the bulk of the site , and they are , in a sense , semi - professionals at what they ' re doing , that the standards we set for ours ##el ##ves are equal to or higher than professional standards of quality .
so somebody says , " dele ##te it , please . dele ##te it - - it ' s not notable . "
and i also like to say she ' s the only person who actually knows all the rules of wikipedia , so . . .
ben saunders : yeah , hi , ben saunders .
i and my colleagues art aron and lucy brown and others , have put 37 people who are mad ##ly in love into a functional mr ##i brain sc ##anne ##r .
almost nobody gets out of love alive .
we found activity in a tiny , little factory near the base of the brain called the vent ##ral te ##g ##mental area .
two thousand years later , we can explain this in the brain .
i ' ve also come to believe that romantic love is an addiction : a perfect ##ly wonderful addiction when it ' s going well , and a perfect ##ly hor ##rib ##le addiction when it ' s going poorly .
our new ##est experiment has been hatch ##ed by my colle ##ague , art aron - - putting people who are reporting that they are still in love , in a long - term relationship , into the functional mr ##i .
so , i will close with this . these are my older people .
i ' m not quite sure .
three : sine ##w used in the outer layer of the lim ##b for maximum tension storage .
dong woo jang : the art of bow - making
and like all the dolphins in our community , we photograph ##ed mu ##gs ##y and track ##ed her little spots and nick ##s in her dorsal fin , and also the unique spot patterns as she mature ##d over time .
and they use these bur ##st - pulse ##d sounds as well as their head - to - head behavior ##s when they ' re fighting .
this underwater keyboard in orlando , florida , at the ep ##cot center , was actually the most so ##phis ##tica ##ted ever two - way interface designed for humans and dolphins to work together under the water and exchange information .
the dive ##r here has a rope toy , and i ' m on the keyboard on the left , and i ' ve just played the rope key , and that ' s the request for the toy from the human .
the dolphin ' s at the keyboard .
denise herz ##ing : could we speak the language of dolphins ?
it ' s based on an argent ##inia ##n rhythm called " carnival ##ito . "
comment ##ator : there he is .
so the idea was , oka ##y , keep that feeling of freedom , but change the vector and increase the time .
because this is - - i ' m quite an experienced manager of systems as a pilot , but this is really - - you need fluid ##ity , you need to be ag ##ile and also to ada ##pt really fast .
so i did try to take , again , a climb altitude .
with that , i have to ada ##pt to something new .
yr : i have a standard answer .
i bet those prehistoric cave artists would have loved to know how to draw better .
wo ##rry ##ingly , there is no consensus about what it is .
we don ' t see those nuclear reactions in stars .
so we per ##cei ##ve nothing as what it really is .
why a marriage contract and not any other reason for regular annual action ?
it ' s the basic regula ##ting principle of the en ##light ##en ##ment .
so this little slide here shows you an op ##tome ##tris ##t and the little blue person represents about 10 , 000 people and that ' s the ratio in the u . k .
i have a global vision for vision .
i have to say , it wasn ' t exactly what i had in mind for my first day down under .
so , the new festival , it asks the audience to play an essential role in sha ##ping the performance .
case in point : when " the sultan ' s elephant " came to london just nine months after 7 / 7 , a london ##er wrote , " for the first time since the london bombing ##s , my daughter called up with that spark ##le back in her voice .
[ " academy award winner for visual effects " ] second doctor : welcome to your new body , jake . first doctor : good .
and what these images are - - you ' ll see them at the start of the slide show - - there ' s only about four images - - but it ' s of a little bear that lives in the great bear rain ##for ##est .
after a while of reading this in the news , it just becomes news .
but unfortunately , 95 percent of the glacier ##s in the arctic are also rece ##ding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not in ##ject ##ing any ice back into the eco ##system .
after an hour in these conditions , it ' s so extreme that , when i go down , almost every dive i vom ##it into my regula ##tor because my body can ' t deal with the stress of the cold on my head .
when i ' m on my death ##bed , i ' m going to remember one story more than any other .
it just sees this big ball ##oon in the ocean - - it doesn ' t have hands - - it ' s going to take a little bit ##e , the boat pop ##s , and off they go .
i put my flip ##pers on . i could bare ##ly part my lips .
this just didn ' t happen a couple of times .
it ' s a story that lives deep in my heart , and i ' m proud to share this with you .
now that you ' re done looking at those , close them down , because every phone has something in common .
now , instead of doing it like mis ##dir ##ection and throwing it off to the side , instead , what i choose to focus on is frank , to be able to play with the frank inside your head , your little security guard , and get you , instead of focusing on your external sense ##s , just to go internal for a second .
do you have a wall ##et on you ? joe : i don ' t .
open your hand . thank you very much .
i ' m going to try to push it inside your hand .
down here i notice ##d this . is this something of yours , sir ?
never have been .
we did not imagine that there would be this many maps around the world .
could we lever ##age these technologies to switch smart ##ly whenever you travel from country to country ?
and the local fina ##ncing is not part of the eco ##system for supporting hardware projects .
we need to look for something else , and we ' ve gott ##en ours ##el ##ves a little bit into a rut .
this last project is also of components .
you can actually pred ##ic ##t what kinds of books they like to read , what kinds of places they like to travel to , and what kinds of food they like to eat .
and by the matrix , i mean literally the matrix , like the movie " the matrix . "
it gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm .
i think this is what we come with , at least a prepared ##ness to learn all of these things .
notice also that on all of these graph ##s , the slope is steep ##er on in - group , authority , pur ##ity .
so this trip ##tych , these three panels port ##ray the time ##less truth that order tend ##s to decay .
because i think that the greatest wonder in the world is not the grand canyon .
they want order , even at some cost to those at the bottom .
can you be not for or against anything ?
what i want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the western world - - australia , united states , u . k . and so on - - face in some of the deployment ##s that they ' re dealing with in the modern world at this time .
so again , they would say , " well if we have access to non - lethal weapons , if we ' ve got someone we know is hostile , we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else around the place , at least , again , we ' re not going to kill them . "
they generally seem to think , " well , why would we care what ' s happened with the police ?
so the next two years were the years they studied - - 2001 , 2002 .
it was used indi ##sc ##rimi ##nate ##ly .
in fact , he was probably six inches taller than me , and she was about this tall .
they ' re trained to be more rest ##rain ##ed in the use of force than the military are .
and the question he had is , " can i do it ? can it be done ? "
we have art students getting together , taking old radia ##tor parts and doing an iron - pour to make something new out of it .
they ' re a bit sub ##vers ##ive in what they do .
and then he didn ' t particularly like school that much , but he got involved in robot ##ics competitions , and he realized he had a talent , and , more important ##ly , he had a real passion for it .
now that could be a dog door , it could be someone going somewhere where they should ##n ' t , like a little brother into a little sister ' s room .
this is steve wo ##znia ##k . where does he learn about computers ?
and drew barry ##more , for all her wonderful char ##m , is not gl ##amo ##rous either .
and this is hed ##y lamar ##r .
this is filip ##pino lip ##pi ' s 1543 portrait of saint apollon ##ia .
so you can do a gl ##amo ##riz ##ed picture of a car , but you can ' t do a gl ##amo ##riz ##ed picture of traffic .
the sense of , you know , life could be better , i could join this - - i could be a perfect person , i could join this perfect world .
so , this session ' s supposed to be about pure pleasure but gl ##amo ##ur ' s really partly about meaning .
it was criticized for gl ##amo ##riz ##ing violence , because , look - - sung ##lasse ##s and those long coat ##s , and , of course , they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things that are impossible in the real world .
so she ' s even more gl ##amo ##rous if you know that she really wasn ' t stu ##pid , even though she thought she could look stu ##pid .
it was a way of loc ##ating myself .
oh sure , sure , i had moments of app ##rec ##iation of my body , the way an abu ##sive parent can sometimes have a moment of kind ##ness .
i heard about a little girl who couldn ' t stop pe ##ein ##g on herself because so many grown soldiers had sho ##ved themselves inside her .
and the fire that burned in me on day three through six of chem ##o is the fire that is burning in the forests of the world .
it was the honey in the water that made it sweet , it was the oil that made it sick .
it was all these things .
obvious ##ly the whole project here is huge .
and ivan puts his sandwich over here , on top of the pirate chest .
which sandwich is he going to take ?
no , because the wind should get in trouble .
now she think ##s the powder is sugar .
oka ##y , so it causes a small in ##vol ##unta ##ry contract ##ion in my hand by putting a magnetic pulse in my brain .
so , there ' s a couple of things to say about tm ##s .
that ' s a great answer . rebecca saxe , thank you very much . that was fantastic .
and sometimes it takes a wake - up call , doesn ' t it , to alert us to the fact that we ' re hur ##ry ##ing through our lives , instead of actually living them ; that we ' re living the fast life , instead of the good life .
but i think if you cut through those forces , you get to what might be the deeper driver , the nu ##b of the question , which is how we think about time itself .
and in this , towns begin to ret ##hin ##k how they organize the urban landscape , so that people are encouraged to slow down and sm ##ell the roses and connect with one another .
and norway , sweden , denmark and finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on earth , and they work the kind of hours that would make the average american wee ##p with en ##vy .
i think there ' s a kind of meta ##ph ##ysi ##cal dimension - - that speed becomes a way of wall ##ing ours ##el ##ves off from the bigger , deeper questions .
i no longer hear time ' s wing ##ed char ##iot drawing near , or at least not as much as i did before .
how do you discover the unique ##ness of a project as unique as a person ?
and when there were comp ##lain ##ts about budget , i said , " well , it ' s worth doing the island because you get twice for your money : reflections . "
and i went down and chief minister bada ##l said to me , " we sikh ##s have suffered a great deal , as you have jews .
and again , i felt kind of un ##com ##fort ##able with the notion that a building the size of the washington building - - 50 , 000 square feet - - will sit on that fragile hill and that we will go into galleries - - rooms with doors and sort of familiar rooms - - to tell the story of the holocaust .
studies for the structure of the roof , which demands maybe new materials : how to make it white , how to make it trans ##lu ##cent , how to make it gl ##owi ##ng , how to make it not cap ##rici ##ous .
so i think i ' m going to start with what i just heard .
so i ' m going to show you , we ' re going to play just for a second .
well we ' re jazz musicians , so stereo ##ty ##pica ##lly we don ' t have a great relationship to finance .
nama ##ste . sala ##am .
i have come from a place of intense darkness .
actually , i come from britain , but i ' ve been living in mal ##di ##ves for 26 years now .
it comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards india .
now , the particular species of dragon ##fly i want to talk about is this one , because most dragon ##flies , like the one we ' ve just seen , when the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life , it doesn ' t go very far . it can ' t travel very far .
and i didn ' t think anything more of it until the following year , when it happened again , and then the year after that , and then the year after that .
you ' re too keen . you ' re too keen . no . hang on . hang on .
it stretch ##es about 500 miles , of course it ' s india here .
that ' s the inter - mons ##oon , the time when the mons ##oon changes .
the larvae have to develop very quickly .
and the dragon ##flies are there . i have reports from my various contacts .
and i only stu ##mble ##d on this because i was living in male , in mal ##di ##ves for long enough for it to per ##cola ##te into my brain that something rather special was going on .
and they are not the only one that makes the crossing .
so , that ' s what i ' ve done with my life .
champion sounds so go ##of ##y , but it ' s what it was , right ?
and this one , look how it slide ##s side ##ways , every which way ?
this one , a little sketch ##y going back ##wards , and watch the back foot , watch the back foot .
and they ' re not all bad .
next . and this is something deeper , and this is where i ' m [UNK] i think i was on tour when i , i was reading one of the fe ##yn ##man biographie ##s . it was the red one or the blue one .
and so many people , i gu ##ess , watch those videos .
but carl norden is really the one who crack ##s the code .
so in the years leading up to the second world war , the u . s . military buy ##s 90 , 000 of these norden bombs ##ight ##s at a cost of $ 14 , 000 each - - again , in 1940 dollars , that ' s a lot of money .
well how many cloud ##less skies do you think there were above central europe between 1940 and 1945 ?
and their mission was to find and to destroy - - remember the sc ##ud missile launch ##ers , those surface - to - air missiles that the iraqi ##s were launch ##ing at the israeli ##s ?
in that exact same period that we ' ve been using these dro ##nes with deva ##stat ##ing accuracy , the number of attacks , of suicide attacks and terrorist attacks , against american forces in afghanistan has increased ten ##fold .
and visiting some pretty incredible places , places like mongolia , cambodia , new guinea , south africa , tanzania twice - - i was here a month ago .
but that ' s not really the question i ' m asking .
but looking around the world at the diversity of humans , he said , " well , you know , we seem to come in disc ##ree ##t sub - species or categories . "
and the whole thing , if you add it all together , is over six billion nucleo ##tides long .
and what that means is that we originated in africa . it ' s written in our dna .
now , africa is the most tropical continent on the planet - - about 85 percent of it lies between cancer and cap ##rico ##rn - - and there aren ' t a lot of glacier ##s here , except on the high mountains here in east africa .
we became much more social . the social networks expanded .
and it ' s based on a few thousand people we ' ve sample ##d from , you know , a hand ##ful of populations around the world .
projects around the world - - documenti ##ng oral poetry in sierra leone , prese ##rvi ##ng traditional we ##avi ##ng patterns in gaza , language rev ##ital ##ization in taj ##ikistan , etc . , etc .
well , the answer seems to be , the universe can create complexity , but with great difficulty .
and at first , it ' s just a blu ##r , but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blu ##r .
stars will create the gold ##ilo ##cks conditions for crossing two new th ##res ##hold ##s .
you also need a great diversity of chemical elements , and you need liquid such as water .
as it copies itself , once in every billion rung ##s , there tend ##s to be an error .
we are blessed with a language , a system of communication , so powerful and so precise that we can share what we ' ve learned with such precision that it can acc ##umu ##late in the collective memory .
collective learning is a very , very powerful force , and it ' s not clear that we humans are in charge of it .
and then they blame the banks for being the bad guys who gave them the mort ##gage ##s .
low - income people spend a lot more than a thousand on lotte ##ries .
take out those who say they save too little .
or as some economist ##s call it , present bias .
what are the implications to saving lives and having organs available ?
it ' s very pain ##ful , even though it doesn ' t mean anything .
maybe we should make people save more when they make more money .
if you ' re thinking about people taking too much risk and not understanding how much risk they ' re taking or taking too little risk , we need to think about that .

i am a neu ##ros ##cient ##ist with a mixed background in physics and medicine .
and i promise to you , this was such an important moment in my career , when i realized that the great leader believed in young people and new ideas .
let me summa ##riz ##e : the rat received a paral ##y ##zing lesion of the spin ##al cor ##d .
they are the result of a young team of very talent ##ed people : physical the ##rap ##ists , neu ##ro ##bio ##logist ##s , neu ##ros ##urg ##eon ##s , engineers of all kinds , who have achieved together what would have been impossible by single individuals .
a spin ##al cor ##d injury can sever the communication between your brain and your body , leading to paral ##ysis . fresh from his lab , gregoire court ##ine shows a new method - - combining drugs , electrical sti ##mula ##tion and a robot - - that could re - aw ##aken the neural pathways and help the body learn again to move on its own . see how it works , as a paral ##y ##zed rat becomes able to run and navi ##gate sta ##irs .
i am an example of what ' s possible when girls from the very beginning of their lives are loved and nur ##ture ##d by the people around them .

and any ##way , to cut the time short - - so i started - - i first went to them and said , " you know , perhaps i could connect all your branches and make you more efficient . "
now , about that cow model i talk ##ed about .

i will show income per person on this axis instead , poor down here , rich up there .
but the real projection ##s for those ones , i would like to give it like this .
for most of my research career , i ' ve been using acc ##eler ##ators , such as the electron acc ##eler ##ator at stanford university , just up the road , to study things on the smallest scale .
in fact , this galaxy and every other galaxy appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter .
now , how do we de ##duc ##e where the galaxy is ?
we call this gravi ##tation ##al lens ##ing .
and also , you can tell by eye , by looking at this , that these arcs are not centered on individual galaxies .
the start ##ling answer to this question , ok , from these experiments , was that space is expanding at a faster rate today than it was a few billion years ago , ok .
one or both , who knows ? or it could be something completely different .
we discovered blue ##grass a few years ago , and we fell in love with it . we hope you guys will too .

so one way to test to see whether we can explain some of this behavior change by differences in life ex ##pect ##anc ##y is to look and see is there more behavior change in areas where there ' s less malaria .
it ' s not the only place we had any intervention ##s .
but since there are very few other diseases that kill people , we can really att ##rib ##ute that mortality to hiv .
and hiv is actually particularly closely linked to transit .
their export ##s went down a lot in the early 1990s - - and actually that decline lines up really , really closely with this decline in new hiv infections .
if i could reveal anything that is hidden from us , at least in modern cultures , it would be to reveal something that we ' ve forgotten , that we used to know as well as we knew our own names .

and you see , everybody ' s busy . there was no time to waste .
text : " help ! i ' ve been waiting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens . "
so let me explain how this works .
and basica ##lly , since we released it about three or four years ago , a lot of websites have started switching from the old cap ##tch ##a where people waste ##d their time to the new cap ##tch ##a where people are helping to dig ##iti ##ze books .
imagine you ' re using the internet and you see a cap ##tch ##a that you think is somewhat peculiar , like this cap ##tch ##a .

we live longer . we have access to technology that would have seemed like science fiction just a few years ago .
maybe these people are right . maybe mind - wand ##ering is a bad thing .
a few minutes ago , i like ##ned mind - wand ##ering to a slot machine you ' d never want to play .
and shortly after , we left the country , and we returned to switzerland .

so when the echo of the guns ##hot ##s had ling ##ered , it was soon dro ##wned by the chant ##ing of the mob , and i didn ' t believe what i was hearing .
now i have learned that my place is not just in the west or in africa , and i ' m still searching for my identity , but i saw ghana create democracy better .
so i ' m going to talk a little bit about that , and what exactly is it that scientists are supposed to do .
so therefore the church said that you can ' t make a vacuum , you know .
the actual nature of reality was not at issue .
and , i mean , everybody in this room - - now , this is 350 short years ago .
i was thinking about making my own little rockets .
it burned kind of slow , but it made a nice sm ##ell , compared to other rocket fuel ##s i had tried , that all had sul ##fur in them .
but that . . . process is what i think of as science , see , where you start with some idea , and then instead of , like , looking up , every authority that you ' ve ever heard of i - - sometimes you do that , if you ' re going to write a paper later , you want to figure out who else has worked on it .
they made all kinds of - - and then finally one giant bomb to end the whole thing , right ?
but nobody actually demonstrated it , right ?
you know , if they said , you know what ?

and if you can , just sc ##rib ##ble a pattern .
and when we gave them a battery , and a piece of wire , and a bu ##lb , and said , " can you do it ? " they couldn ' t do it . right ?
between australia and here , right , they ' ve got summer and we ' ve got winter , and what - - does the earth kind of rush towards the sun at night , and then rush back again ? i mean , it ' s a very strange thing going on , and we hold these two models in our head , of what ' s right and what isn ' t right , and we do that , as human beings , in all sort ##s of fields .
so , children are not empty vessels , ok ?
now - - oh , oh yeah , go on then , go on .
so when i thought about it , then suddenly i realized that biology gave us the answer .
so as a chem ##ist , i wanted to say , " hang on . what is going on here ?
you have regulation ; information is trans ##cribed ; cat ##aly ##sts are made ; stuff is happen ##ing .
so there are two options : intelligent design , direct and indi ##rec ##t - - so god , or my friend .
i need some information , and i need a container .
if we manage to do that , forget the molecular detail .
you ' re sitting on chair ##s .
because the thing is , we are so chau ##vini ##stic to biology , if you take away carbon , there ' s other things that can happen .
and i will take kenya as an example .

the fuel , like i said , is ce ##rami ##c inside zi ##rco ##nium fuel rod ##s , and in the event of an accident in one of these type of reactor ##s , fu ##kus ##hima and three mile island - - looking back at three mile island , we didn ' t really see this for a while [UNK] but these zi ##rco ##nium cl ##ad ##ding ##s on these fuel rod ##s , what happens is , when they see high pressure water , steam , in an o ##xid ##izing environment , they ' ll actually produce hydrogen , and that hydrogen has this explosive capability to release fis ##sion products .
everybody was really ex ##cite ##d about cur ##ios ##ity , and that had this big pluton ##ium battery on board that has pluton ##ium - 238 , which actually has a higher specific activity than the low - enric ##hed uranium fuel of these molte ##n salt reactor ##s , which means that the effects would be negli ##gi ##ble , because you launch it cold , and when it gets into space is where you actually activa ##te this reactor .
so , we moved from an industrial economy to a service - based economy .

from the smallest wis ##p of air to the powerful forces of nature ' s storm ##s .
it allows us to contribute and to be heard as individuals .
doubt and fear always cree ##p in .
yeah , it also went into the pacific .
the folk ##s at aero ##vir ##on ##ment tried 300 or more different wing designs , 12 different forms of the avion ##ics .
i work with some of the most amazing people .
and there is no way , and no proof of arrival .
this story began four years ago .
i ' m used to algorithms and data structures and super motiv ##ated students , and nothing in my background prepared me to deal with a rag ##ing , violent adolescent in the middle of nowhere .
when he was eight , someone put him on a boat in odessa and sent him , ship ##ped him to israel on his own .
i tell kids when they struggle through some up ##hill and feel like they cannot take it any ##more , it really helps to ign ##ore the immediate obstacles and raise your head and look around and see how the vista around you grows .
now i remember , when he said it , i felt goose ##bum ##ps on my body , because he said it over ##loo ##king the mo ##ab mountains here in the background .
what is real is separate ##ness , and at some point in early baby ##hood , the idea of self starts to form .
it has an extremely important function .
well , i thought i had the answer to that one , and i said , " skin color . "
the self ' s struggle for aut ##henti ##city and definition will never end unless it ' s connected to its creator - - to you and to me .
and if you can do that , incredible things happen .
and this influenced me .
so it ' s got hybrid drive .
and so we spent time traveling with them and learning about all the different elements , and finding that there were pl ##enty of ine ##ffi ##cien ##cies that were ##n ' t being capital ##ized on .
so there are up to a million people there everyday .
by the way , we had half the budget of the other western nations .
the british government - - any government is potentially the worst client in the world you could ever possibly want to have .
thank you .
one of them , from anthropology , is the study of human universal ##s .
but if something is written on the slate , then some people could have more of it than others , and according to this line of thinking , that would just ##ify discrimination and ine ##qua ##lity .
well , pretty soon they were barrage ##d with en ##rage ##d letters , death threats , ban on the topic in a number of scientific journals , coming from ira ##te left - hande ##rs and their advocate ##s , and they were literally afraid to open their mail because of the venom and vit ##upe ##ration that they had ina ##d ##verte ##nt ##ly inspired .
by any economic standard , the demand for art of all forms is sky ##rock ##etin ##g , as you can tell from the price of opera tickets , by the number of books sold , by the number of books published , the number of musical titles released , the number of new albums and so on .
well , the argument in " the blank slate " was that elite art and criticism in the 20th century , although not the arts in general , have dis ##dain ##ed beauty , pleasure , clar ##ity , insight and style .
wrong . identical twins , or any siblings , who are separated at birth are no less similar than if they had grown up together .
so i called the human ##e society and i say , " look , i ' m going to be cast ##rating some lamb ##s , can you tell me the deal ? "
and i ' m like that ' s not rubber at all , you know .
and i said , " yes , like the human ##e society .
albert inst ##ru ##cts , " push it way up there . "
it ' s what our network does ; it ' s what " dirty jobs " is .
i can still see hillary doing the shots of ry ##e , dr ##ib ##bling down her chin , with the steel workers .
you ask him , " did you follow your passion here ? "
uns ##pea ##kab ##ly dangerous .
you see him all the time .
i got a lot wrong .
i ' ve got parent - child relation ##al problems , which i blame my parents for .
but he fake ##d it too well , and now he ' s stuck in broad ##moor and nobody will believe he ' s san ##e .
fake madness .
it ' s just impossible . "
and his clinic ##ian said to me , " if you want to know more about psycho ##pat ##hs , you can go on a psycho ##pat ##h spot ##ting course run by robert hare who invented the psycho ##pat ##h checklist . "
can i come and interview you about your special brain ano ##mal ##y ? "
and he looked intr ##igue ##d despite himself , and he said , " oka ##y , go on . "
and we sti ##tch them together like medieval monks .
any ##way , that was two years ago , and that ' s where my book ended .
let me say parent ##hetic ##ally why i think that ' s the case , because i think it ' s a potentially controversial statement .
you can show a mosque , or you can show worship ##pers , but there ' s not a straight ##for ##ward way of depicting islam .
and the hope ##ful response derives from rec ##og ##ni ##zing that islam and democracy are technologies .
because they would have done extra ##ord ##inar ##ily well .
and it is crucial - - it is crucial in a practical , activist way - - for people who care about these issues to make sure that within the technology of democracy , in this system , they exercise their preference ##s , their choice ##s and their voices to encourage that outcome .
now at the time , i was working down the street .
and collective ##ly , we really didn ' t know if we could pull this off .
but an interesting thing was noted during the training process .
and they could be extinct in less than 10 years , if we don ' t do something now to protect them .
corner row railway , station car park , front of a health center , people ' s front gardens , and even in front of the police station .
so , back to the public meeting .
so we got some land that was donated by a local garden center .
which ##ever way they want to do it , of their own voli ##tion , they ' re trying to make their own lives different ##ly , and worldwide , we ' ve got communities across america and japan - - it ' s incredible , isn ' t it ? i mean , america and japan and new zealand .
and i ' m also rather surprise ##d , because when i look back on my life the last thing i ever wanted to do was write , or be in any way involved in religion .
so if religion is not about believing things , what is it about ?
and this struggle to find comp ##ass ##ion in some of these rather re ##bar ##bati ##ve texts is a good dress re ##hea ##rsal for doing the same in ordinary life .
tell us where we ' re going wrong . let ' s talk together about where religion is failing . "
it ' s what is meant by over ##coming the horror that we feel when we are under threat of our enemies , and beginning to app ##rec ##iate the other .
as we go smaller , here is a human hair .
so this little ant that ' s cr ##aw ##ling here , it ' s like it ' s in a little willy won ##ka land .
i couldn ' t believe it , and i ' d go around disse ##cting the little bits out and making photographs of them .
now , the moon has no atmosphere , so micro ##mete ##ori ##tes come in continuously , and the whole surface of the moon is covered with powder now , because for four billion years it ' s been bomba ##rde ##d by micro ##mete ##ori ##tes , and when micro ##mete ##ori ##tes come in at about 20 to 60 , 000 miles an hour , they vapor ##ize on contact .
it was just one of those pot - luck things where you get it right first time .
the design comes from within .
technology in x - ray where it ' s life - size process ##ed , apart from these large cargo - sc ##anning machines , has ##n ' t moved on enough for the quality of the image and the resolution to be good enough for what i want to do with it , which is show my pictures big .
and when they do , i ' m in the queue .
and that ' s how this was done . it ' s actually sl ##ice , sl ##ice .
but i could get a bit dark ##er in the tube , but everything else would suffer .
and i think that would look quite nea ##t as an x - ray .
but i also don ' t understand how it does ruin the magic .
but every single thing that makes us , every atom in us , has already created a my ##ria ##d of different things and will go on to create a my ##ria ##d of new things .
now i know you don ' t think that .
every time i breath ##e in , i ' m breath ##ing in a million - billion - billion atoms of oxygen .
meet tony . he ' s my student .
maybe it ' s you , maybe it ' s me - - but we ' re not here to trade opinions ; everyone ' s got an opinion .
and i say to tony , " let ' s do this . "
everything was oka ##y , until i got to about the age of 26 , and i went to a movie called " short circuit . "
and this is happen ##ing here .
so you start really understanding that you can have diseases , to ##xin ##s , a need to balance your diet , and once you start looking , and from that point on , everything i have done in terms of the consumption of information , the production of information , the preparation of information , i ' ve looked at from the view ##point of food .
we ' ve spent a great deal of time in ##vesti ##gating a $ 1 billion - - that ' s right , a $ 1 billion [UNK] oil deal that he was involved with , and what we found was pretty shock ##ing , but more about that later .
a bank in paris held accounts of companies controlled by him , one of which was used to buy the art , and american banks , well , they fun ##nel ##ed 73 million dollars into the states , some of which was used to buy that california mansion .
it found that over 70 percent of those cases had used anonymous shell companies , total ##ing almost 56 billion dollars .
now , it just should ##n ' t take these sort ##s of efforts to find out where the money in deals like this went .
i see this word , hear this word , feel this word every ##w ##here .
you become your nation . you become your religion .
i loved when he was talking about this other world that ' s right next to this world .
she ' s a high school student .
not running from loss , but entering gr ##ief , surrender ##ing to sor ##row .
because when you spend a lot of time going from place to place , country to country , and city to city , the degree to which women , for example , are viola ##ted , and the epi ##dem ##ic of it , and the kind of ord ##inar ##iness of it , is so deva ##stat ##ing to one ' s soul that you have to take the time , or i have to take the time now , to process that .
now i was stu ##pid , but not so stu ##pid that i turned it down .
pure content and pure form , side by side .
i was so waste ##d . "
i set up the type , i printed it out on an eps ##on print ##er with water - sol ##uble ink , tape ##d it to the wall and threw a buck ##et of water at it . presto !
seriously .
not exactly jackie collins .
like my wish that no one went hung ##ry or that everything were a free kind of utopia .
we love challenges , but when expectations are low , trust me , we will sin ##k to them .
and in case you don ' t think that this really has meaning for you , remember that cl ##oning is possible , and that involves going through childhood again , in which case you ' ll want to be heard just like my generation .
when i began recording in the late ' 60 ##s , the typical methods of recording were limited to the fragment ##ed capture of individual species like birds mostly , in the beginning , but later animals like mammals and amphibian ##s .
however , our ear ##s tell us a very different story .
this is probably the sad ##dest sound i ' ve ever heard coming from any organi ##sm , human or other .
the school teachers were ##n ' t having much fun , the sports were very dirty or very pain ##ful .
but of course the scientists couldn ' t help themselves .
so there ' s a lot more female game ##rs than people are really aware .
so as far as popularity of games , what do you think these people are doing here ?
and once we get enough of those guys , we ' re going to want more fantasy artists that can create places we ' ve never been to before , or characters that we ' ve just never seen before .
i ' m add ##ic ##ted , because even though i know i ' m losing my grip on reality , i still cr ##ave more .
no button ##s to push , no trigger ##s to pull , just me and the game .
but maybe brain ##was ##hing isn ' t always bad .
as far as colleges go , there ' s about 350 colleges around the world teaching video game courses .
thank you .
some ##how we have to understand ours ##el ##ves to get around our fl ##aw ##s .
so a kid who ' s 14 in high school gets this version of the p ##yth ##ago ##rean theorem , which is a truly sub ##tle and interesting proof , but in fact it ' s not a good way to start learning about mathematics .
and the math ##ema ##tician ##s and scientists in the crowd will recognize these two progression ##s as a first - order discrete differential equation and a second - order discrete differential equation , derived by six - year - old ##s .
so if you look at the little script here , the speed is always going to be 30 .
and they say , " oh , yeah . constant acceleration .
the future of life , where the un ##rave ##ling of our biology - - and bring up the lights a little bit . i don ' t have any slide ##s .
now i know there ' s been a whole lot of hy ##pe about our power to control biology .
it will really make us question what it is to be a human being .
and it is really not suite ##d for the future that we ' re moving into .
there are three obvious ways of doing this .
humanity is going to go down this path .
the one thing though that is really dangerous about these sort ##s of technologies , is that it ' s easy to become sed ##uce ##d by them .
and then what comes out of it ? new life .
gregory stock : to upgrade is human
it ' s our own pond . and that ' s how it happens . "
mom , does the man just say , ' is now the time to take off my pan ##ts ? ' " and i said , " yes . "
and then she goes , " mom , do you think they would have , on the internet , any humans matin ##g ? "
so the possibility exists to simply external ##ly wr ##ap the pipe .
once you ' ve made it , the installation ' s quite easy .
and as you can see , there are not only two principal technical disciplines there , medicine and engineering , but also there are various specialist ##s from within those two disciplines .
i ' m sure it ' s the same in poland .
they simply want to do whatever they ' ve done before .
and as a result , it ' s an entirely different use of the technology and the knowledge around you .
that makes a good cartoon .
it has rock ##ed the music industry ; it has changed the way we con ##sum ##e music .
you know the story .
and i went to see the do ##zo .
and i didn ' t ask them to do nice cartoons .
thank you .
if you go back two billion years , you ' re not on an earth - like planet any more .
we are right now in the beautiful ore ##o of existence - - of at least life on planet earth - - following the first hor ##rib ##le micro ##bia ##l age .
and the black rock is the sed ##iment on the sea bottom in the absence of plan ##kt ##on .
these are mammal - like reptiles .
the survivors that do get through produce this world of cr ##oco ##dile - like creatures .
it can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen , and is totally satu ##rated with hydrogen sul ##fi ##de - - enough , for instance , to come out of solution .
it ' s been on this planet since the animals first started - - 500 million years .
now , the same mouse is given 80 parts per million hydrogen sul ##fi ##de in this solid graph , and look what happens to its temperature .
am i understanding you right , that what you ' re saying here is that we have in our own bodies a bio ##chemical response to hydrogen sul ##fi ##de that in your mind proves that there have been past mass extinction ##s due to climate change ?
it ' s forced child labor and all of those products probably end their lives in a dum ##p like this one in manila .
and their factory in china - - which probably is pretty clean - - is getting all of the ingredients from back ##yard aba ##tto ##irs , where families slaughter pig ##s and extra ##ct the ing ##redi ##ent .
their voters are local .
even if they did their jobs , and they cited those facilities for their violation ##s , the fine would be deri ##sor ##y .
you can call yourself responsible , but responsibility without account ##ability often doesn ' t work .
there are thousands of suppl ##iers in there . "
join us , come into that safe space , and let ' s start to make this happen .
you will put the star in starting over , and over .
so i write poems to figure things out .
now i can divide my spoken word journey into three steps .
and then someone else has something the complete opposite of yours .
it ' s not that i think that spoken word poetry is the ideal art form .
and i always thought that my beginning was at the bow ##ery poetry club , but it ' s possible that it was much earlier .
it ' s what i str ##ive for every time i open my mouth - - that impossible connection .
i was a student in the ' 60 ##s , a time of social up ##hea ##val and question ##ing , and on a personal level , an awakening sense of ideal ##ism .
but i was driven by an in ##herent sense that a picture that revealed the true face of war would almost by definition be an anti - war photograph .
one of the things i had to learn as a journalist was what to do with my anger .
this man had just been libera ##ted from a hut ##u death camp .
i spent a good deal of time with a man who lived with his family on a railway em ##bank ##ment and had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident .
an ms ##f hospital in a camp for dis ##placed people .
this is a helicopter medi ##c giving cp ##r to a soldier who had been shot in the head .
whenever there is an election , it seems like something always goes wrong , someone tries to che ##at , or something goes accidentally aw ##ry - - a ballot box goes missing here , chad ##s are left hanging over here .
and there ' s some complicated cry ##pt ##ography going on in there , but what ' s not complicated is voting with one of these forms .
david bis ##mark demos a new system for voting that contains a simple , veri ##fia ##ble way to prevent fraud and mis ##cou ##nting - - while keeping each person ' s vote secret .
but that sub ##di ##vide ##s christianity , islam and buddhism into many sub ##group ##s , which was too detailed .
but there was also many christian countries that had six to seven bab ##ies per woman .
but there are also countries here like guatemala , like papua new guinea , like yemen and afghanistan .
here we have qatar today , and there we have bangladesh today .
and the world population will stop growing .
and then again the old will die and you will get two billion children .
i wound up on every television show .
we declared small ##po ##x era ##dica ##ted in 1980 .
but in that year , small ##po ##x ex ##plo ##ded throughout india .
we failed three other times .
this year , that one hospital will give back sight to more than 300 , 000 people in tamil nadu , india .
within three weeks it will be every ##w ##here in the world .
but in all serious ##ness - - because this idea is birth ##ed in ted , i would like it to be a legacy of ted , and i ' d like to call it the " international system for total early disease detection . "
but they were able to point to who and let them know that there was this sur ##pris ##ing and une ##x ##pla ##ined cluster of illness ##es that looked like bird fl ##u .
the first number is three : three billion people .
we know from asking people from china to the u . s .
you ' ll change your smart ##phone seven or eight times , probably more if you ' re in this audience .
actually , we found 100 percent is easier to do than 90 percent or 50 percent .
the electricity is free .
and we do not want to wait another hundred years .
there was this equation in my family that went something like this : if you are intelligent , you therefore are not spiritual .
i ' ve always been attracted to those rare people who pull that off , who dev ##ote their lives to humanity with the gr ##it of the warrior and the grace of the mystic - - people like martin luther king , jr . , who wrote , " i can never be what i ou ##ght to be until you are what you ou ##ght to be .
or maybe your brother - in - law who doesn ' t believe in global warm ##ing .
we agreed we ' d speak up in our own communities when we witness ##ed the kind of " other ##izing " talk that can wound and feste ##r into para ##no ##ia and then be used by those on the fringe ##s to inc ##ite .
i traveled to iraq , afghanistan and liberia .
and he ' s on a mission .
and that they were definit ##ely capable of di ##ff ##using it non - aggressive ##ly .
but the question that ling ##ered in my mind was , what causes people to destroy fire trucks headed to their own homes ?
it ' s been reported that wiki ##lea ##ks , your baby , has , in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world ' s media combined .
and then the government sat on it and used it for political lever ##age on moi , who was the riches ##t man - - still is the riches ##t man - - in kenya .
roger . i got ' em .
j well , because these sort of things reveal what the true state of , say , arab governments are like , the true human - rights abuse ##s in those governments .
it will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all , and that ' s our hope .
and the engineering report had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extremely difficult document for us .
can that be right ?
that made you very high - profile in iceland . what happened next ?
the musicians played off a three - dimensional graph of weather data like this .
the vertical elements are assigned a specific hour of the day .
lauren hod ##ge : if you were going to a restaurant and wanted a health ##ier option , which would you choose , gr ##ille ##d or fried chicken ?

sounds rid ##icu ##lou ##s , right .
in fact , it ' s one of the biggest problems with chem ##oth ##era ##py today .
1 . 6 million deaths worldwide .
so julie ' s going to her doctor ' s office to get treated for her as ##th ##ma .
so i want you to rei ##ma ##gine a world with better air quality , better quality of life and better quality of living for everyone including our future generations .
and just like that , i went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as " disabled " to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn ' t have yet .
and interesting ##ly , from an identity stand ##point , what does it mean to have a disability ?
so w ##him ##sy matters .
thank you .
so after being inter ##roga ##ted by this japanese manager for a half an hour , he finally said , " so , miss yang , do you have any questions to ask me ? "
so today i want to talk about young people through the platform of social media .
first of all , most of them were born in the 80 ##s and 90 ##s , under the one - child policy .
so for the past few years , the coastal areas , they found themselves in a short ##age of labor .
while young people seem to be very sure about their participation in public policy - making , but sometimes they ' re a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life .
and our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves .
these mountains are dangerous places , but ultimately the fate of these bear families , and indeed that of all bears around the north pacific , depends on the salmon .
nece ##ssi ##ty is the mother of evolution .
but just looking up with the naked eye , you really don ' t need one .
a culture which is top - down , owned , where the vocal chor ##ds of the millions have been lost .
now , as ##cap said they didn ' t care .
i want to share all my love with you . . .
the extrem ##ism on one side beg ##ets extrem ##ism on the other , a fact we should have learned many , many times over , and both extreme ##s in this debate are just wrong .
we can only make them , quote , " pirates . " and is that good ?
because we ' re far from home , we ' re very tire ##d . "
so i know it may sound like tough love , but look , if at some point you got lied to , it ' s because you agreed to get lied to .
if you don ' t want to be dec ##ei ##ved , you have to know , what is it that you ' re hung ##ry for ?
lying has evolutionary value to us as a species .
the rest of us , we ' re only 54 percent accurate .
we all chat ##ter with our finger ##tip ##s .
they ' re going to be inf ##uria ##ted if they sense they ' re wrong ##ly accused throughout the entire course of the interview , not just in flash ##es ; they ' ll be inf ##uria ##ted throughout the entire course of the interview .
your new joint venture partner might shake your hand , celebrate , go out to dinner with you and then lea ##k an expression of anger .
don ' t be too aggressive , it doesn ' t work .
but you ' ve got to ask yourself in the meant ##ime : who do you want on your side of the meeting , someone who ' s trained in getting to the truth or some guy who ' s going to drag a 400 - pound electro ##ence ##pha ##log ##ram through the door ?
it ' s down ##hill from now on . i wanted to thank eme ##ka and chris .
that ' s very important .
nigeria got its independence in 1960 .
so i had a very in ##venti ##ve teacher , a pakistani muslim , who wanted to teach us about this .
and fraser ' s on his knee ##s , arms tied behind his back , and he ' s cry ##ing .
and i watched them being locked up in prison and tear gas ##sed .
my friend ronald gottes ##man says there are three kinds of people in the world : those who can count , and those who can ' t .
one of my favorite parts of my job at the gates foundation is that i get to travel to the developing world , and i do that quite regularly .
they tap into local entrepreneur ##ial talent , and they do incredible marketing .
and they decided in 1990 that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneur ##s , giving them small loans .
now the reason these micro - entrepreneur ##s can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their push ##car ##t or their wheel ##bar ##row .
and i think that ' s a mistake .
we know that ci ##rc ##um ##cisi ##on reduce ##s hiv infection by 60 percent in men .
well on september 4th , there was a huge mo ##p - up campaign , which is what you do in poli ##o .
i ' m going to tell you two things today : one is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back .
this is where you can see most of the florida keys national marine sanctuary .
but still , now we have global warm ##ing .
and this is what i saw , lots of fish .
so the fisher ##men are catch ##ing more .
so how much of this do we have ?
which takes us to the third reason , why we don ' t have many more reserves , is that the funding models have been wrong .
so , basica ##lly , the production sur ##plus of these guys down there is enough to maintain this bio ##mas ##s that is not moving .
and there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a larger thing or of a larger global eco ##system .
we use the submarine alvin and we use cameras , and the cameras are something that bill lange has developed with the help of sony .
they ' re very little understood .
and there ' s ten ##s of thousands of those mountains out there that haven ' t been map ##ped yet .
what we find out now is that it ' s probably coming from inside the earth .
there are never any lights there , except the lights that we bring .
they don ' t need the sun at all .
bl : this bacteria that we ' ve been talking about turns out to be the most simples ##t form of life found .
el nino comes and goes . it ' s not a disaster , it ' s rhythm ##ic .
this is what we would love students to retain , even if they don ' t go into mathematical fields .
i believe in real life .
and then as we start to define what does steep ##ness mean , we reali ##ze it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down , specifically what that means .
how long will it take it to fill it up ?
and why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high - quality curriculum in our front pocket .
the lesson of brian ' s presentation , in a way - - all those fantastic pictures - - is this really : that vant ##age point determine ##s everything that you see .
it was bor ##ing .
so the challenges of education in this kind of place are not to learn the kings and queens of kenya or britain .
what do they look like ?
waiting 10 years for the pay ##off from education is too long when you need to meet daily needs , when you ' ve got siblings to look after or a business to help with .
that ' s one city .
and there will be no mistake ##s . "
you ' d need millions and millions of teachers in china , india , nigeria and the rest of developing world to meet need .
but it is , unlike cars , which have developed so rapidly and order ##ly , actually the school system is rec ##og ##ni ##za ##bly an inheritance from the 19th century , from a bis ##mark ##ian model of german school ##ing that got taken up by english reformer ##s , and often by religious mission ##aries , taken up in the united states as a force of social co ##hes ##ion , and then in japan and south korea as they developed .
so as i ' m watching this , i see this powerful scene that brought me to tears , and it stuck with me for the past 25 years .
and because i have a 15 - year - old , all i do is cook and cook and cook .
it ' s really scar ##y , this gay lifestyle thing ; it ' s super du ##per evil and there ' s no end to it !
the u . s . constitution is the gay agenda .
but when you see the map , and you see our state of michigan - - it ' s legal to fire someone for being gay , lesbian , bis ##ex ##ual or trans ##gender ##ed , that it ' s legal to remove someone from their home because they ' re gay , lesbian , bis ##ex ##ual or trans ##gender ##ed , then you reali ##ze that this whole conversation about marriage equality is not about strip ##ping someone ' s rights away , it ' s about grant ##ing them the rights that [ have ] already been stated .
thank you .
some of the studies even say we ' re hap ##pier .
entro ##py means that everything in the world , everything , is in a state of decline and decay , the arch .
how was i supposed to live it ?
if however , we can go back and alter our relationship , re - vision our relationship to past people and events , neural pathways can change .
i know what ' s on your mind when you ' re looking at these pictures .
they have to try and attract poll ##inato ##rs to do their bid ##ding .
it ' s a wonderful , amazing thing .
this is the phil ##oden ##dron sello ##um .
last week i took these pictures of rock rose , hel ##iant ##hem ##um , in dorset .
maybe you ' re ti ##cke ##d off , or maybe you ' re looking forward to a new game . you ' ve been up too late playing a game .
and he goes all around the country taking pictures of himself , and you can see here he ' s got zi ##g ' s indian reservation . and this particular shot , this is one of the more traditional shots . this is a rain dancer .
and she says , " they want to go . " and i said , " honey , no they don ' t want to go . this is the middle passage .
this is a game with 50 , 000 individual pieces .
what you ' re looking at is airplane traffic over north america for a 24 - hour period .
you see the holding patterns that start to develop in the bottom of the screen .
so they made this web service and said , " any programmer can write a piece of software and tap into the minds of thousands of people . "
that gives you an idea of the different types of motivation ##s and dedicat ##ion .
so we took a hundred dollar bill and divided it into 10 , 000 teen ##y pieces , and we fed those into the mechanical turk .
you ' d be fed a simple audio clip .
but we knew we really needed the right person to kind of rally behind and build something for .
ak : so if you go to the website johnny ##cas ##hp ##roj ##ect . com , what you ' ll see is the video playing above .
win butler : now our lives are changing fast now our lives are changing fast hope that something pure can last hope that something pure can last oo ##h we used to wait oo ##h we used to wait oo ##h we used to wait sometimes it never came sometimes it never came still moving through the pain we used to wait for it we used to wait for it we used to wait for it ak : so i think , if there ' s one thing to take away from my talk today , it ' s that an interface can be a powerful narrative device .
and it ' s also just getting to the essential of things .
so if you don ' t know one of these languages , it ' s instant learning .
here it ' s " candy ##city . "
and parallel to my cutting is my running .
it ' s not auto ##bio ##graphic ##al ide ##nti ##ties .
so for the subway in new york , i saw a correspondence between riding the subway and reading .
so it acts as a screen to protect the rail and the com ##mut ##er , and not to have objects falling on the rails .
beatrice coro ##n : stories cut from paper
now , the opposite of a sn ##ob is your mother .
en ##vy , it ' s a real tab ##oo to mention en ##vy , but if there is one dominant emotion in modern society , that is en ##vy .
there is another reason why we might be feeling more an ##xio ##us , about our careers , about our status in the world today , than ever before .
but i think it ' s insan ##e to believe that we will ever make a society that is gen ##uine ##ly merito ##c ##rati ##c . it ' s an impossible dream .
now is there any alternative to this ?
and so we tend to worship ours ##el ##ves .
psycho ##ana ##lys ##is has been drum ##ming home this message for about 80 years .
because otherwise it can get quite claus ##trop ##ho ##bic .
and i decided the rem ##edy to all this mala ##ise was going to be for me to chase an elevated dream , an extreme dream , something that would require ut ##ter conviction and un ##wave ##ring passion , something that would make me be my best self in every aspect of my life , every minute of every day , because the dream was so big that i couldn ' t get there without that kind of behavior and that kind of conviction .
the navigation is difficult .
and i couldn ' t wait to trip the mind fantastic .
and every one of those bar ##bs is sending that venom into this central nervous system .
and i sw ##am through the night and i sw ##am through the next day .
and a little kid from the back was like this .
yeah .
thank you . thank you .
and what about sleep ?
this is a device that not only measures card ##iac rhythm , as you saw already , but it also goes well beyond that .
that looks like this .
it ' s usually 90 percent . so , you tell me you sleep better than expected .
now , diabetes is one of the big ones .
there are two things that can really acc ##eler ##ate this whole process .
so , i hope i ' ve convinced you of this , of the impact on hospital clinic resources is prof ##oun ##d and then the impact on diseases is equally impressive across all these different diseases and more .
how do we make stable societies ? longe ##vity .
and you get to think about yourself and your memories , and before you go back into suspension , you edit your memories and you change your personality and so forth .
and , of course , we ' re not responsible for the consequences of what we ' re doing now , are we ? like all this comp ##lain ##t about clone ##s .
thank you .
so we tried , and i ' ll show you what we came up with .
so you can lav ##ish all the same care , all the same technique , on a hamburger as you would on some much more fan ##cy dish .
so it ' s very much like in a hollywood movie where a guy flies through the air , supported by wire ##s , and then they take the wire ##s away digital ##ly so you ' re flying through the air .
that horn - shaped region is what we call the sweet spot .
and because people watch myth ##bus ##ters and csi , i thought , well , let ' s put in a reci ##pe for a ball ##istic ##s gela ##tin .
but maybe if i cut a hole in his head i can fix it . "
i mean who would put themselves through that ?
lap ##aros ##co ##py is doing this kind of surgery : surgery with long instruments through small inc ##ision ##s .
and now , in contrast to the lap ##aros ##co ##py , you can precise ##ly place the need ##le in your instruments , and you can pass it all the way through and follow it in a traje ##ctor ##y .
and you need to re - set it up .
we get to write the script of the next revolution in surgery .
we can he ##al the disease .
we realized that when plastic ##s get to the dum ##p , it ' s difficult to sort them because they have similar dens ##ities , and when they ' re mixed with organic matter and construction debris , it ' s truly impossible to pick them out and environmental ##ly eliminate them .
not only do ph ##thal ##ates poll ##ute our environment , but they also poll ##ute our bodies .
this means that our bacteria were actually living off of ph ##thal ##ates .
thank you . j ##y : thank you .
but people live on this land .
this is an unusual installation of airport seat ##ing .
its early version had an " x " base . that ' s what the collector ##s like .
here ' s a film we ' ve been hearing things about .
so we ' re going to watch another film .
so , " i saw many trains and also rode on one .
and there are a lot of fun things . this is the museum of the bench .
it ' s about how you approach problems . and there is this huge , beautiful common ##ali ##ty between design , business and the world .
that ' s what we all need to do .
it was mind - blow ##ing .
but if corruption cree ##ps in and people don ' t have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law , then if you can use violence , if you can use violence with imp ##uni ##ty , you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable into slavery .
so , that ' s a scenario that we think we should be capital ##izing on .
these young boys are in nepal .
liberation , however , costs some money .
children rescue ##d from slavery in the fishing industry in ghana , reunit ##ed with their parents , and then taken with their parents back to their villages to re ##bu ##ild their economic well - being so that they become slave - proof - - absolute ##ly une ##ns ##lave ##able .
however , only recently , due to several technological advancement ##s , we are now able to demonstrate to you quantum levi ##tation and quantum lock ##ing .
well , first there are strand ##s of magnetic field left inside , but now the super ##con ##ductor doesn ' t like them moving around , because their movements dis ##si ##pat ##e energy , which breaks the super ##con ##duct ##ivity state .
now , i can extend this circular magnet , and make whatever track i want .
and it was also inspired by this quote from douglas adams , and the situation is from " the hit ##ch ##hi ##ker ' s guide to the galaxy . "
but any ##way , i got my suit ##case of iron ore and drag ##ged it back to london on the train , and then was faced with the problem : oka ##y , how do you make this rock into components for a toa ##ster ?
and the last material i ' m going to talk about today is plastic , and , of course , my toa ##ster had to have a plastic case .
that ' s it without the case on .
when i was a student at mit , we all shared one computer that took up a whole building .
so we updated them , so i could present it here , to 2007 .
communication technologies : 50 different ways to measure this , the number of bits being moved around , the size of the internet .
and we will begin to actually deeply influence our health and our intelligence , as we get closer and closer to this technology .
this was in an area called well ##awa ##tta , a prime residential area in colombo .
for hours afterwards , the sea was str ##ew ##n with bits of wood for miles around - - all of this was from the houses in the sl ##um .
voice 1 : it ' s coming again . voice 2 : new wave ?
and it ' s one that offers really interesting pos ##si ##bilities for organizing a whole host of activities down the road .
it is very easy to fall in love with the dec ##ent ##rali ##zed , bottom - up structure of the internet .
and there ' s this famous example of one that was 1 , 200 feet long and lasted for two days , and the ants just kept marching around and around in a circle until they died .
i keep thinking about these kids with no arms .
i ' m going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this that we demonstrated in washington . can we look at this thing ?
it all began when two scientists , fred grass ##le and jesse aus ##ube ##l , met in woods hole , massachusetts where both were guests at the fame ##d oceano ##graphic institute .
and with salt ##ing , it became possible to store fish and to transport it long distances .
and so one of the tools that we can use to sample the oceans is acoustic ##s , or sound waves .
well what they found was mis ##lab ##ele ##d fish .
this is something we ' ve actually known for a while , so it ' s not a real breakthrough .
but the really interesting thing about it is that , a few years ago , census scientists discovered that this guy can th ##rive in oxygen - poor sed ##iments in the deep mediterranean sea .
so we still have quite a lot of work to do in terms of unknown ##s .
and the oceans are so product ##ive , there ' s so much going on in there that ' s of rele ##van ##ce to humans that we really need to , even from a self ##ish perspective , try to do better than we have in the past .
and we do something different than what we did in the past ; we add kind of a modi ##cum of intelligence to that .
you know , i am so bad at tech that my daughter - - who is now 41 - - when she was five , was over ##hea ##rd by me to say to a friend of her ##s , if it doesn ' t ble ##ed when you cut it , my daddy doesn ' t understand it .
the indo - european root of the word hope is a stem , k - e - u - - we would spell it k - e - u ; it ' s pronounced koy - - and it is the same root from which the word curve comes from .
and i think that it ' s going to be , in time , the elements of the human spirit that we ' ve been hearing about bit by bit by bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days .
we are , should be , moral ##ly committed to being the he ##aler of the world .
now that ' s not quite true . there ' s one other way , and that ' s through sw ##eat ##ing .
now why is that top problem so easy and the bottom problem so hard ?
you send a command down , it causes muscles to contract .
so what are beliefs ?
and what bay ##es ' rule says is that i should multi ##pl ##y the numbers on the red by the numbers on the green to get the numbers of the yellow , which have the elli ##pse ##s , and that ' s my belief .
now there ' s good reason to believe that you would want to be able to distinguish external events from internal events .
as you go from 0 . 1 to 0 . 2 , it becomes more ti ##ck ##lis ##h at the end .
we started with a motor with a little lever , a little force trans ##fus ##er .
so i have a huge amount of choice to make .
if i choose a different way of moving - - on the right for example - - then i ' ll have a different command , different noise , playing through a noi ##sy system , very complicated .
you have to study vision with the realizat ##ion of how the movement system is going to use vision .
and yes , the red planet is red .
here are some recent images .
and what we ' re looking at is the presence of the gas met ##hane , ch ##4 , in the atmosphere of mars .
in the southern hemisphere there are impact crater ##s , there are volcanic crater ##s .
we will fly where the met ##hane is .
we believe that in a one - hour flight we can re ##wr ##ite the text ##book on mars by making high - resolution measurements of the atmosphere , looking for gases of bio ##geni ##c origin , looking for gases of volcanic origin , studying the surface , studying the magnet ##ism on the surface , which we don ' t understand , as well as about a dozen other areas .
if you ' re interested in more information , we have a website that describes this ex ##citi ##ng and intr ##igu ##ing mission , and why we want to do it .
i was like , " yeah .
then you notice that if that lego - provided cad program isn ' t enough , there ' s an entire open - source , third - party , independent lego cad program that let ##s you do 3d modeling and 3d rende ##ring and make , in fact , movies out of lego , 3d films of which there are thousands on youtube , and some of them sort of mimi ##cki ##ng famous films and some totally original content - - just beautiful - - and people rec ##rea ##ting all sort ##s of things .
i ' m really scar ##ed . i don ' t think we ' re going to make it .
so , look what they did .
but the pay - off is really eno ##rm ##ous .
california emi ##ts only seven percent of u . s . co ##2 emissions .
every year a million and a half people die of a completely prevent ##able disease . that ' s malaria . 6 , 000 people a day .
do you know , they only in ##vest ##ed 0 . 2 percent of revenue ##s in r & amp ; d ?
it could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century .
every dot is a person .
because , as i said , we live our lives in networks , and these networks have a particular kind of a structure .
so , if we want to track something that was spread ##ing through a network , what we ideal ##ly would like to do is to set up sensor ##s on the central individuals within the network , including node a , monitor those people that are right there in the middle of the network , and some ##how get an early detection of whatever it is that is spread ##ing through the network .
so , we thought we would ex ##plo ##it this idea in order to study whether we could pred ##ic ##t phenomena within networks .
and the size of the dot ##s is going to be proportion ##al to how many of their friends have the fl ##u .
and the answer is no .
and there are three ways , i think , that these massive - passive data can be used .
over the past seven years , i ' ve been following my fas ##cina ##tion with the built environment , and for those of you who know me , you would say that this ob ##ses ##sion has led me to live out of a suit ##case 365 days a year .
and you even find a church .
today , they live in this area , approximately 50 , 000 to 70 , 000 people , who live in this community of self - built multi - story houses where up to three generations live in one structure .
in a region famous for the soft , por ##ous lo ##ess plateau soil , there lived until recently an estimated 40 million people in these houses underground .
so you know how it ended up , spencer tracy brought a computer , a main ##fra ##me computer of 1957 , in to help the libr ##arian ##s .
on the right are some tu ##gs from a company called ae ##th ##on in pittsburgh .
so a person that ' s intera ##cting with the robot understand ##s where it ' s going to reach and isn ' t surprise ##d by its motion ##s .
mild ##red ' s a factory worker in connecticut .
and turned up the other way , the people who are retirement age goes up very , very fast , as the baby boom ##ers get to retirement age .
the system measures the beam ' s time of flight , recording the time it takes for the light to hit a surface and make its return .
and here , this is a fly - through the cloud of points of tika ##l , and here you see it rendered and photo - textu ##red with the photography that we take of the site .
last march , we received very sad news .
ben ka ##cy ##ra : ancient wonder ##s captured in 3d
we had holocaust education in the schools .
it will refer you directly to your congress ##person , to your u . s . senator , to your governor where dive ##st ##ment legislation is pen ##ding .
european governments , for the most part , haven ' t acknowledged responsibility , and there ' s nothing to kind of to push back and up against .
he was bobby kennedy - like because in some ways one could never tell if he was a reali ##st masque ##radi ##ng as an ideal ##ist or an ideal ##ist masque ##radi ##ng as a reali ##st , as people always wonder ##ed about bobby kennedy and john kennedy in that way .
but , uh - oh , the killers are within the camps .
you ' re un - owned .
don ' t black - box history . don ' t check your principles at the door .
fourth and final point : he some ##how , because he was working in all the world ' s worst places and all lesser evil ##s , had a hum ##ility , of course , and an awareness of the complexity of the world around him .
some are driven by comp ##ass ##ion , feel it ' s perhaps one of the fundamental acts of humanity .
a hundred years ago , we didn ' t .
and yet , in many places , a third of the children , by the time they ' re three already are facing a life of hard ##ship due to this .
and these types of technologies , i see , have the potential to transform the face of hunger and nutrition , mal ##nut ##riti ##on out on the front lines .
well two years ago , we decided , let ' s transform the model of fighting hunger , and instead of giving out the food aid , we put it into food banks .
it is a win - win - win situation that starts the food economy moving .
well , the world bank estimates it would take about 10 billion dollars - - 10 . 3 - - to address mal ##nut ##riti ##on in those countries .
so , this is an as ##tou ##nding table .
as one gets older ? very , very common .
why ? because we know what you have , and we know how to treat it - - although we can ' t make va ##cci ##ne in this country , but that ' s a different story .
and i think that ' s been the fundamental problem over the last five decades , is that we have str ##ive ##d to understand cancer .
and so , if you think of cancer as a system , there ' s an input and an output and a state in the middle .
if i give a woman with breast cancer a drug called tax ##ol every three weeks , which is the standard , about 40 percent of women with meta ##stat ##ic cancer have a great response to that drug .
so , instead of a reduction ##ist view , we ' re taking a step back .
the problem is that , if i ' m this doc , and i get your ct sc ##an today and you ' ve got a two centimeter mass in your liver , and you come back to me in three months and it ' s three centimeter ##s , did that drug help you or not ?
and so , as a cancer doctor , instead of having paper in my chart , in your chart , and it being this thick , this is what data flow is starting to look like in our offices , where that drop of blood is creating gi ##gab ##yte ##s of data .
most people find that very sooth ##ing , and , interesting ##ly , 12 cycles per minute is roughly the frequency of the breath ##ing of a sleeping human .
so if i were to play this - - - - for more than a few seconds , you ' d feel un ##com ##fort ##able ; for more than a few minutes , you ' d be leaving the room in drove ##s .
you all recognize that one . this is the most - played tune in the world today .
and i stood there beside two very good friends of mine , richard weber and kevin valle ##ly .
so we would have a live website , that every single day of the 33 days , we would be blog ##ging , telling stories of , you know , de ##ple ##ted oz ##one forcing us to cover our faces , or we will burn .
that i ' m this uber - endurance guy ?
i actually love diving at night ; you see a lot of fish then that you don ' t see in the daytime .
no matter where on earth you live .
we can go actually and swim around on google earth and visit with hum ##p ##back whale ##s .
we kill using long lines , with bai ##ted hook ##s every few feet that may stretch for 50 miles or more .
and , in 1972 , this nation began to establish a counter ##part in the sea , national marine san ##ctu ##aries .
but , nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean .
without insects , there ' d be no flowering plants .
they have another set of eyes on the top of their head .
a mouse has about 1 , 000 times as many neu ##rons as a fly .
and these are the two concepts i ' d like to explore .
so this is the preparation that one of my former post - doc ##s , gab ##y mai ##mon , who ' s now at rockefeller , developed , and it ' s basica ##lly a flight sim ##ulator but under conditions where you actually can stick an electro ##de in the brain of the fly and record from a genetica ##lly identified neu ##ron in the fly ' s brain .
the first is , it ' s essential for us to understand the human brain if we do want to get along in society , and i think that it is a key step in evolution .
so i can say , with some certain ##ty , " i think , therefore i am . "
we ' re just pack ##ing in columns , so that we ' d have more neo ##cor ##tica ##l columns to perform more complex functions .
and we did that for ten ##s of thousands of neu ##rons , built digital models of all the different types of neu ##rons we came across .
and when we do that what we discovered is that the circuit ##ry does change .
now , when you look at that the first time , you think , " my god . how is reality coming out of that ? "
this took place in my childhood - - 1957 to ' 65 .
" spaces ##hip project officially begun . job waiting for you . dy ##son . "
so , these are three - pound charges of c4 ; that ' s about 10 times what the guy had in his shoes .
this is a 20 man version for going to jupiter : bun ##ks , storm cell ##ars , exercise room .
you know , i don ' t know how many of those you read , but it ' s not fun to read and often not fun to write - - even worse to write .
which i think is just fas ##cina ##ting .
very very hard .
giving your organs to somebody else is probably about how much you care about society , how linked you are .
interesting ##ly enough , when people get this , they again don ' t check - - but now they join .
this is from a paper by rede ##lme ##ier and sc ##ha ##efer .
there is one more decision .
a print sub ##scription for 125 .
and because we don ' t know our preference ##s that well we ' re sus ##ceptible to all of these influences from the external forces : the default ##s , the particular options that are presented to us , and so on .
the silver lin ##ing is , i think , kind of the reason that behavioral economics is interesting and ex ##citi ##ng .
they are scar ##ce ; they are expensive ; and we only have a certain range of it .
and then we have the radio waves , they have the issues i ' ve just mentioned .
and this is a fundamental basic property that we ex ##plo ##it with our technology .
you think , " ha , ha , ha .
and then i ' ve mentioned the availability .
and then you have these millions of street lamp ##s deployed around the world .
you ' ve heard of dna ; you probably studied a little bit in biology .
and look at all the complex things and wonderful things we ' ve been able to create with just a one and a zero .
and then james watson ' s - - one of the co - founders of dna - - genome was done for two million dollars , and in just two months .
an architect far better and smart ##er than us has given us that tool ##box , and we now have the ability to use it .
we could produce better fl ##avo ##rs and ar ##omas .
and he had the best answer i ever heard to this question : " well , somebody has to . "
i ' m sn ##iff ##ing this other dog ' s rear end , the owner ' s calling . "
and what you will find is a very , very low - ranking bit ##ch will quite easily keep a bone away from a high - ranking male .
and that ' s how we use the food lur ##e in the hand , and we use food because we ' re dealing with owners .
so we go , " sit , " on the co ##uch ; " sit , " tum ##my - ru ##b ; " sit , " look , i throw a tennis ball ; " sit , " say hello to that other dog .
they think a punishment is something nas ##ty .
your head now is 100 yards away , sailing through the air , ok ?
and ugly face is this - - when you go face - to - face with a pu ##ppy or a child , you say , " what are you doing ! now stop it , stop it , stop it ! "
it really is .
speaking at the 2007 eg conference , trainer ian dun ##bar asks us to see the world through the eyes of our belo ##ved dogs . by knowing our pet ##s ' perspective , we can build their love and trust . it ' s a message that reso ##nate ##s well beyond the animal world .
and you made it out of what ?
wk : yeah , i want to build another one - - to pump water and irrigation for crops .
and so this is basica ##lly a song about loop ##s , but not the kind of loop ##s that i make up here .
and that ' s what the song is asking .
every time i read che ##kh ##ov and his unique vision of human life , i ' m remi ##nded of why i too became a writer .
what about bigger numbers ?
that ' s a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do math , i ' m sure .
the hare itself , the animal - - not a cat , not a dog , a hare - - why a hare ?
how did we become the only species that becomes more pro ##sper ##ous as it becomes more pop ##ulous ?
and it ' s this combination , this cumu ##lati ##ve technology , that intr ##igues me , because i think it ' s the secret to understanding what ' s happen ##ing in the world .
there ' s no exchange of ideas between them .
and that ' s seven and a half seconds of pro ##sper ##ity that you ' ve gained since 1950 , as it were , because that ' s seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else , or you can acquire another good or service .
we ' re able to draw upon speciali ##zation and exchange to raise each other ' s living standards .
and so both sides raise each other ' s standards of living through the sexual division of labor .
and that will have led to speciali ##zation .
the person on the assembly line doesn ' t know because he doesn ' t know how to dr ##ill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic , and so on .
my work is about the behavior ##s that we all engage in un ##cons ##cious ##ly , on a collective level .
and that ' s gone up since then , but we don ' t have the numbers yet .
and this is what the next piece is about .
as we try to build this view , and try to edu ##cate ours ##el ##ves about the eno ##rmi ##ty of our culture , the information that we have to work with is these gi ##ganti ##c numbers : numbers in the millions , in the hundreds of millions , in the billion ##s and now in the tri ##llion ##s .
you ' re looking at the outside shell of the virus , and the yellow color here are those parts of the virus that are evo ##lv ##ing very , very fast , and the blue parts are not evo ##lv ##ing very fast .
but really , it ' s pretty rob ##ust .
and there ' re only 102 because people got bore ##d collecting them : there are just new ones every year .
so that ' s great , but again , cheap shot , right ?
we put the bee ##per in the clinic .
i mean , they went to the max for this woman .
and what i ' m telling you here from the signal , is that men who have a mutation in this anti ##vira ##l defense enzyme , and have a tumor , often have - - 40 percent of the time - - a signature which reveals a new retro ##virus .

it ' s pretty cool , at least in theory .

donald sad ##owa ##y : the missing link to rene ##wa ##ble energy
so i want to give you a quick story of how it got started .
did you find the gold ?
things where you might trip across things like the cope ##rni ##can principle , the fermi paradox , the ant ##hr ##opi ##c principle , the origin of life .
so pretty much players are encouraged to be very creative in the game .
so this is the planet that we ' ve been playing on up to this point in the game .
now here , our entire oceans are eva ##pora ##ting off the surface , and as it keeps getting hot ##ter at some point the entire planet ' s going to mel ##t down .
and so you ' d have this wonderful spark ##ling thing , with the disk slowly rota ##ting , and this is roughly what it would look like . and so really , part of this is about bringing the beauty of this , of the natural world , to somebody in a very ima ##gina ##tive way , so that they can start cali ##bra ##ting their inst ##in ##ct across these vast scales of space and time .
even the bbc and the new york times .
so they do this both when they have power sort of chronic ##ally , and also when they ' re feeling powerful in the moment .
so business schools have been str ##uggling with this gender grade gap .
probably not , right ? you want the person who ' s powerful and asse ##rti ##ve and dominant , but not very stress rea ##ctive , the person who ' s laid back .
so two minutes lead to these hor ##mona ##l changes that con ##figur ##e your brain to basica ##lly be either asse ##rti ##ve , con ##fi ##dent and comfort ##able , or really stress - rea ##ctive , and , you know , feeling sort of shut down . and we ' ve all had the feeling , right ?
we also eva ##lua ##te these people much more positive ##ly overall . "
and the night before my first - year talk , and the first - year talk at princeton is a 20 - minute talk to 20 people . that ' s it .
two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
so you ' re out in the woods , or you ' re out in the past ##ure , and you see this ant cr ##aw ##ling up this blade of grass .
many people have laid down their lives for communis ##m , and many have laid down their lives for capital ##ism .
now , what theories do we want to use to look at this ?
not silicon .
there are other parasit ##es that do this - - which rende ##r the host ster ##ile .
they ' re not a big deal for us .
now in the old days , conducting , music making , was less about trust and more , frank ##ly , about co ##er ##cion .
i have to say , in those days , i couldn ' t really even find the bird .
they don ' t read music .
do you hear it ?
well done , ladies and gentlemen .
lyn : when i ' m making music , i feel like a pilot in the cockpit flying an airplane .
my uncle ed gave me a beautiful blue sw ##eat ##er - - at least i thought it was beautiful .
we focused on a business model ; we ins ##isted on skin in the game .

how do we deal with our deep ##est differences , given the human prop ##ensi ##ty for conflict and the human genius at devi ##sing weapons of eno ##rm ##ous destruction ?
and we can play an inc ##redi ##bly construct ##ive role .
now let me take you for a moment to what ' s widely regarded as the world ' s most difficult conflict , or the most impossible conflict , is the middle east .
now as ant ##hr ##op ##ologist ##s , we know that every culture has an origin story .
and that ' s what comes to the first step here .
let me ask you a question .
and so that ' s what it ' s about .
but they did it thanks to a common identity - - europe - - and a common economy .
natalie mac ##master : cape breton fi ##dd ##ling in reel time
first step , the medical doctor went away for about six months , and he worked on what were to become these nine health goals , what were we aim ##ing at .
you and your kids are fine .
that ' s our average budget .
they do all aspects of the work .
they could trap the flies , send them to him in perth .
i put it to you , is this eli ##minat ##ing poverty ?
so when i do my job , people hate me .
and second , i don ' t care about the word , i care about how you use it .
i ' m not saying it ' s easy .
but it all starts with seeds in classroom ##s , in my place , which looks like this .
and what ' d we do then ? well , i met nice people like you , and they invited us to the hampton ##s .
that ' s a picture i took of my bronx borough president , address ##ing my kids in his house , not the jail ##house , making them feel a part of it .
so we started giving back .
and when you expand their pala ##tes , you expand their voc ##ab ##ular ##y .
and again , when you can take kids from background ##s as diverse as this to do something as special as this , we ' re really creating a moment .
people , you can all do that .
si se puede !
well , with the pig , at the basel ##ine , before we blocked the pig ' s arter ##y to sim ##ulate a heart attack , that was the signal .
so there it was , thursday morning we stopped the pig ' s medica ##tion and there is his electro ##gram , the signal from inside the pig ' s heart coming out by radio tele ##metry .
that ' s the first invention that i wanted to describe .
stacy sager : but for christina side ##bot ##tom , almost anything was worth trying if it could stop a mig ##rain ##e .
this is probably a better picture .
a signal in the brain that trigger ##s brain dy ##sf ##un ##ction might be sense ##d as a trigger for electro - sti ##mula ##tion like we ' re doing with epi ##lep ##sy .
everybody knows that we can do better with a visual thing that can be interactive with the patient , where they see the video and they ' re being video ##ed and they press , do you understand this ? no , i don ' t .
and so there is a team of developers from all over africa , who are part of this team now - - from ghana , from malawi , from kenya .
you see this with twitter , too . you get this information over ##load .
after he died , i realized that no one writes to me any ##more .
in fact , so many different points of resonance that it ' s going to be difficult to bring them all up , but i ' ll try to do my best .
think of it as a massive itunes for book type content .
companies like national instruments , who are em ##bed ##ding very powerful , interactive simulation ##s into the materials , so that we can go way beyond our regular kind of text ##book to an experience that all the teaching materials are things you can actually intera ##ct with and play around with and actually learn as you do .
so what we ' re seeing is moving this burning or publication process from the regular sort of single - authored book towards community - authored materials that are modul ##ar , that are custom ##ized to each individual class and published on demand very ine ##x ##pens ##ivel ##y , either pushed out through amazon , or published directly through an on - demand press , like co ##op .
and people who are teachers out here , who ##ever taught , you know this - - it ' s the inter ##con ##nec ##tions between ideas that teaching is really all about .
we ' re not talking about harry potter , right ?
and if you read the press , it actually last week said i quit the media lab .
and these are two ane ##cd ##otes - - one was in cambodia , in a village that has no electricity , no water , no television , no telephone , but has broad ##band internet now .
we ' re interested in big displays , bright displays .
it ' s the rest - - that little brown box - - that is pretty fas ##cina ##ting , because the rest of your lap ##top is devoted to itself .
is it all worked out ? no .
by law you ' ve got to bid , and so on and so forth .
because there ' s no market for post office trucks .
and if it comes out at 138 dollars , so what ?
we can put anything we want into it , and it doesn ' t get he ##avier , and then we can take anything out .
and i said , " i want to do that . "
these are the people that you have access to right now , in general - - all of these people , all of your friends and family that you can connect to .
i want you to take a trip with me .
in resource - rich countries , with all the tests and treatment we currently have , less than two percent of bab ##ies are born hiv - positive - - 98 percent of bab ##ies are born hiv - negative .
these women are here for care , but we know that just doing a test , just giving someone a drug , it ' s not enough .
your baby is going to be hiv - negative . "
the second : keep mothers healthy , keep mothers alive , keep the children alive - - no more or ##pha ##ns .
she had been asked by one of the clients to go to the home of the client , because the client wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and sisters about her hiv status , and she was afraid to go by herself .
we ' ve chosen to rede ##fine the health care system as a doctor , a nurse and a mentor mother .
mothers with hiv car ##ing for mothers with hiv .
it ' s proportion ##ally much bigger in humans than in any other species , and it ' s involved in a whole range of high level cognitive functions , things like decision - making , planning , planning what you ' re going to do tomorrow or next week or next year , in ##hi ##biti ##ng ina ##pp ##rop ##riat ##e behavior , so stop ##ping yourself saying something really rude or doing something really stu ##pid .
there are three trucks there . you ' re going to inst ##in ##ctive ##ly go for the white truck , because that ' s the top truck from your perspective , but then you have to remember , " oh , he can ' t see that truck , so he must mean me to move the blue truck , " which is the top truck from his perspective . now believe it or not , normal , healthy , intelligent adults like you make errors about 50 percent of the time on that kind of trial .
but now we try to understand that in terms of the development of a part of their brain called the limbi ##c system , so i ' m going to show you the limbi ##c system in red in the slide behind me , and also on this brain .
see , he owned a chr ##omium plati ##ng company , and they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals , and so he needed an industrial robot like this that could basica ##lly do the heavy lift ##ing .
but i knew what he meant , because it would be possible to take a bun ##ch of pictures of flowers in a garden and then , basica ##lly , index them in a computer system such that it would appear that there was a real robot when there wasn ' t .
she said , when she was just about to walk on stage , the tele - directors were still trying to agree on what to do , and so she just walked on stage and did what felt most natural .
human demonstration ##s , they ' re all noi ##sy and imp ##er ##fect , and we extra ##ct from them an inf ##erre ##d task traje ##ctor ##y and control sequence for the robot .
the more that robots ing ##rain themselves into our everyday lives , the more we ' re forced to ex ##amine ours ##el ##ves as people . at ted ##x ##ber ##kel ##ey , ken goldberg shares four very human lessons that he ' s learned from working with robots . & lt ; em & gt ; & lt ; / em & gt ;
in fact , it is said that in the collective consciousness of africa , we get to experience the deep ##est parts of our own humanity through our interactions with others .
and there was something so beautiful ##ly african about it to me , this small house with a huge heart in it .
as i come out of the water , soll ##y arrives at a deep section , a channel between us .
she arrived at our reserve from a reserve east of us on her mig ##rator ##y route .
and while it ' s true that ubuntu is an african idea , what i see is the essence of that value being invented here .
now ka ##esa ##va had a baby boy called re ##han a couple of weeks ago .
perhaps loss of memory is so crucial for our survival as human beings .
well , when i think of the future , i never see myself moving forward in time . i actually see time moving back ##ward towards me .
i actually included stories from my grandmother .
i must ad ##mit , i used to be one of them .
i discovered that there ' s a movement for a better way .
bir ##ke bae ##hr : what ' s wrong with our food system
and you can see that it kind of hockey stick ##s up around the 1960s and ' 70 ##s , and it ' s on kind of a nice traje ##ctor ##y right now .
sea ##mou ##nts are important for biodiversity .
and what ' s the context of the phoenix islands ?
i ' d like to go back and share it with the government of kiri ##bati , who are over in tara ##wa , the western ##most group .
it had occurred on land , in rain ##for ##est ##s of south america and africa , where lando ##wne ##rs had been paid not to cut the trees down .
it ' s almost like if a person has multiple diseases , it ' s hard to get well , you might die , but if you only have one disease to deal with , you can get better .
i ' ve just described to you the one story behind that rectangular area in the middle , the phoenix islands , but every other green patch on that has its own story .
just in the past couple years , we ' ve seen digital tools display skills and abilities that they never , ever had before , and that , kind of , eat deeply into what we human beings do for a living . let me give you a couple examples .
in the short term , we can sti ##mula ##te job growth by en ##cou ##rag ##ing entrepreneur ##ship and by in ##vesti ##ng in infrastructure , because the robots today still aren ' t very good at fix ##ing bridges .
so the work of innovation , the work of coming up with new ideas , is some of the most powerful , some of the most fundamental work that we can do in an economy . and this is kind of how we used to do innovation .
thanks very much .
this is 1983 .
and , last ##ly , under " harmony , " they had this 13th - century manda ##la from tibet .
he didn ' t want any of his friends to be arrested , so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card .
which brought me back to my list making - - you know , just to see what i actually like about my job .
then it ' s : " gut ##s . "
the other condition is in societies living in marginal or fl ##uc ##tua ##ting environments , such as the arctic or desert ##s , where there are periodic food short ##ages , and occasionally there just isn ' t enough food to keep everyone alive .
for example , there ' s particular emphasis on respect for the elderly in east asia , associated with con ##fu ##cius ' doctrine of filial piet ##y , which means obe ##dien ##ce , respect and support for elderly parents .
perhaps the biggest change for the worse is that our elderly are objective ##ly less useful than in traditional societies .
unfortunately , all of those terrible situations could come back .
those are just some examples of what we can learn from traditional societies .
and so the back ##stor ##y of the 99 takes place in 1258 , which history tells us the mongol ##s in ##vade ##d baghdad and destroyed it .
the concept centers on something called the noor stones .
i got accused in a few blogs that i was actually sent by the pope to pre ##ach the trinity and catholic ##ism in the middle east , so you - - you believe who you want . i gave you my version of the story .
top right is stuart moore , a writer for iron man .
opened a theme park through a license in kuwait a year and a half ago called the 99 village theme park - - 300 , 000 square feet , 20 rides , all with our characters : a couple back - to - school license ##s in spain and turkey .
i don ' t dese ##rve it . i don ' t dese ##rve anything .
and the first one was about a group called the party of god , who wanted to ban valentine ' s day . red was made illegal .
raya ##n ref ##ram ##ed the situation and brought himself down to my level .
that is , they ' re meaning ##less without context : 500 billion for this pipeline , 20 billion for this war .
so i want to show you another landscape now .
why april ?
yeah , retail therapy might help .
there ' s something almost quite magical about visual information .
so massive , in fact , that it can contain all the other military budget ##s in the world inside itself .
we need relative figures that are connected to other data so that we can see a fuller picture , and then that can lead to us changing our perspective .
so let ' s filter that out .
i mean , i find information just too interesting .
now what you are sm ##elling is a combination of - - i asked how many molecules there were in there , and nobody would tell me .
and that ' s a perfect ##ly reason ##able theory in the sense that almost everything else in biology works by shape .
this is cis - 3 - he ##xen ##e - 1 - ol . it sm ##ells of cut grass .
the bad news is they ' re rocket fuel ##s .
this is the basis for the device that these two guys at ford built .
and i said , first of all , let me do the calculation on that compound , bottom right , which is related to co ##uma ##rin , but has an extra pen ##tag ##on ins ##erte ##d into the molecule .
i come out of the advertising and design business .
running through this typical letter that they had , i ran it through my sim ##plici ##ty lab , it ' s pretty uni ##nte ##lli ##gi ##ble .

the adoption process took , like , a matter of months , so it was a closed shop , you know , seal ##ed deal , an industri ##ous , util ##itaria ##n solution : the government , the farmer , the adopt ##ing parents , the consumer , the mother , the earth , and the child , the crop .
and i was on the cu ##sp of , sort of , ado ##les ##cence , so i was starting to take bis ##cuit ##s from the tin without asking .
but because i had no family to in ##qui ##re about me , they could do anything to me .
lemn sis ##say : a child of the state
we still really haven ' t got a very complete picture of it .
and if you look north here , there ' s a big river that flows into the lake that ' s been carrying sed ##iment and prese ##rvi ##ng the remains of the animals that lived there .
and he remained there until 1 . 6 million years later , when this very famous fossil hunter , kam ##oya kim ##eu , walked along a small hills ##ide and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pe ##bble ##s , recognized it as being homi ##ni ##d .
i think it ' s our collective intelligence .
well , to end on a very positive note , i think evolution ##ari ##ly speaking , this is probably a fairly good thing , in the end .
this fold ##er has 17 , 000 photos - - over 20 gi ##gab ##yte ##s of information - - and it ' s growing constantly .
you can see that i even made a museum label for it that includes a brief history of the dod ##o .
it ' s funny to me that it took a while to aut ##henti ##cate it , because i can see it compared to this thing , and i can tell you - - it ' s real , it ' s the real thing , it ' s made from the exact same mol ##d that this one is .
i ' ll go you one stranger than that : in 1974 , during the production of a weird comedy sequel to " the maltese falcon , " called " the black bird , " starring george sega ##l , the los angeles county museum of art had a pla ##ster original of the maltese falcon - - one of the original six pla ##sters , i think , made for the movie - - stolen out of the museum . a lot of people thought it was a public ##ity stu ##nt for the movie .
there ' s a thing that happens when you mol ##d and cast things , which is that every time you throw it into silicon ##e and cast it in res ##in , you lose a little bit of volume , you lose a little bit of size .
i had extensive and life - threat ##ening injuries .
the next concern was whether i would walk again , because i was paral ##y ##zed from the wai ##st down .
i was lying on a thin , hard spin ##al bed .
in the spin ##al ward , that ' s normal .
it was everybody ' s pain . and then i knew , just like before , that i had a choice . i could keep fighting this or i could let go and accept not only my body but the circumstances of my life .
and they took one look and ran out the back to draw short str ##aw ##s .
so i went home , i got a training diary out , and i had a plan .
the pilot light inside of me was still a light , just as it is in each and every one of us .
and we should be developing things - - we should be developing pack ##aging for ideas which elev ##ate people ' s perception ##s and respect for the things that we dig out of the earth and trans ##late into products for everyday use .
when i do make some money , i ' ll have one machine ##d for myself .
it comes back to inst ##in ##ct .
it cost 1 . 7 million dollars to develop . it ' s called " go " by bernhard ##t , usa .
that is the power of organic design .
it ' s grown in my mind , and then it ' s grown in terms of the whole process that i go through .
i ' ve been bang ##ing on about this like i can ' t believe .
and that ' s what i do with my furniture .
it ' s in not ##ting hill next to all the cr ##ap - - you know , the prost ##itu ##tes and all that stuff .
on the wall is my book called " supernatural , " which allows me to remember what i ' ve done , because i forget .
we trained in a tank in port hue ##nem ##e , and then my first open ocean dive was in santa barbara channel .
like those big explosion ##s , sparks , are from a little com ##b je ##lly , and there ' s kr ##ill and other kinds of crustaceans , and je ##lly ##fish .
now , this one is blue , and that ' s the color of most biol ##umi ##nes ##cence in the ocean because evolution has selected for the color that travels far ##thes ##t through sea ##water in order to op ##timi ##ze communication .
he ' s got to find himself a babe and then he ' s got to lat ##ch on for life .
and then to generate the display you ' re about to see , all i did was touch it once per second on its nerve ring with a sharp pick that ' s sort of like the sharp tooth of a fish .
but there came a moment when it all came together , and everything worked .
edith wi ##dde ##r : gl ##owi ##ng life in an underwater world
so as we are facing all the multiple crise ##s in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what ' s going to bring more joy , gra ##titude , effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world .
so i - - i took my camera , i took my note ##book , took a chair , and started to observe this behavior .
here ' s one of my fellow winners . that ' s charles pax ##ton who won the 2000 biology prize for his paper , " courts ##hip behavior of ost ##rich ##es towards humans under farming conditions in britain . "
the missionary position is very rare in the animal kingdom .
and when it ' s over , we go to a chinese restaurant and we have a six - course duck dinner .
it had become a part of my body , an extension of my sense ##s , and after some time , it even became a part of my official image .
prince charles has some similar ##ities with nicole kid ##man .
and the good thing about per ##cei ##ving ultra ##vio ##let is that you can hear if it ' s a good day or a bad day to sun ##bat ##he , because ultra ##vio ##let is a dangerous color , a color that can actually kill us , so i think we should all have this wish to per ##cei ##ve things that we cannot per ##cei ##ve .
she was who ##lly un ##con ##cer ##ned about the bears , but she was ter ##rif ##ied of lawyers .
but the reality is , these crazy cases are relatively rare . they don ' t usually win .
it ' s very hard to measure because there are mixed motive ##s .
it doesn ' t seem to be working very well does it ?
people - - for law to be the platform for freedom , people have to trust it .
so , what ' s needed now is to re ##bu ##ild these boundaries .
that person doesn ' t exist today .
it ' s the only way to get our freedom back , and it ' s the only way to release the energy and passion needed so that we can meet the challenges of our time . thank you .
or - - or maybe and - - in addition to rules , let ' s see if we can come up with some really cle ##ver ince ##nti ##ves so that , even if the people we deal with don ' t particularly want to serve our interests , it is in their interest to serve our interest - - the magic ince ##nti ##ves that will get people to do the right thing even out of pure self ##ish ##ness .
well if you think about it , it ' s really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler .
he had a pretty low - wage job .
he did after all have a toy gun .
but the problem with re ##lying on rules and ince ##nti ##ves is that they demo ##rali ##ze professional activity , and they demo ##rali ##ze professional activity in two sense ##s .
so can ##ny out ##law ##s are better than nothing , but it ' s hard to imagine any can ##ny out ##law sus ##taining that for an inde ##fini ##te period of time .
there are now 22 cities that have veterans ' courts like this .
so there are lots of examples like this that we talk about .
the united states had developed a couple of atomic weapons through the manhattan project , and the idea was very straight ##for ##ward : we would use the power of the atom to end the at ##roci ##ties and the horror of this une ##nding world war ii that we ' d been involved in in europe and in the pacific .
during this chapter one , there was a high level of public awareness about the potential of nuclear cat ##ast ##rophe , and an inde ##lib ##le image was imp ##lante ##d in our collective minds that , in fact , a nuclear holocaust would be absolute ##ly global ##ly des ##tru ##ctive and could , in some ways , mean the end of civilization as we know it .
so the goal was to eva ##cua ##te the target cities .
there are many , many sites where war ##head ##s are stored and , in fact , lots of sites where fis ##sion ##able materials , like highly enric ##hed uranium and pluton ##ium , are absolute ##ly not safe .
they are very dedicated and committed .
this is the size of the " little boy " bomb that was dropped at hiroshima .
in that 10 to 15 minutes , all you have to do - - and i mean this seriously - - is go about a mile away from the blast .
so separation - - hope ##fully with dirt or concrete , or being in a basement - - distance and time is what will save you .
serious problems , big problems , pressi ##ng problems .
and many of us here are deeply involved in that .
and that ' s clear ##er now than it ' s been for decades .
that ' s what business does when it makes a profit .
business does not profit from causing social problems , actually not in any fundamental sense .
we see companies like the brazilian forestry company fi ##bria that ' s figure ##d out how to avoid tear ##ing down old growth forest and using eucalyptus and getting much more yield per hectare of pulp and making much more paper than you could make by cutting down those old trees .
if we can break down this sort of divide , this une ##ase , this tension , this sense that we ' re not fundamental ##ly colla ##bora ##ting here in driving these social problems , we can break this down , and we finally , i think , can have solutions .
this shows a lot of internal structures .
it doesn ' t have to be always disse ##ction .
they ' re even more shock ##ed by what he says .
they talk ##ed about science and the need for a new scientific revolution .
each month required 1 , 365 calculation ##s , so these tables were filled with mistake ##s .
there ' s a flip side as well .
one day a nasa manager comes into my office , sits down and says , " can you please tell us , how do we look for life outside earth ? "
so he was convinced , but , in fact , most people aren ' t .
and it is in fact due to this arms race between hacker ##s and operating system designers that things go back and forth .
and as you see here , there are groups that are growing on top of each other , because they are spread ##ing .
and obvious ##ly each of these letters comes off about roughly equally frequent .
it doesn ' t matter what kind of sed ##iment you ' re using to gr ##ind up , whether it ' s bacteria or any other plants or animals .
so let ' s see what that looks like .
and if we remove the mystery of life , then i think it is a little bit easier for us to think about how we live , and how perhaps we ' re not as special as we always think we are .
this is a paper form , and what you ' re looking at is a paper form in the hand of a ministry of health nurse in indonesia who is tram ##ping out across the countryside in indonesia on , i ' m sure , a very hot and hum ##id day , and she is going to be knock ##ing on thousands of doors over a period of weeks or months , knock ##ing on the doors and saying , " ex ##cus ##e me , we ' d like to ask you some questions .
now try and wr ##ap your head around that for a second .
the problem was , after a few years of doing that , i realized i had done - - i had been to maybe six or seven programs , and i thought , you know , if i keep this up at this pace , over my whole career , maybe i ' m going to go to maybe 20 or 30 programs .
now you may not think of hot ##mai ##l as being mira ##culo ##us , but for me it was mira ##culo ##us , because i notice ##d , just as i was wrestling with this problem , i was working in sub - sahara ##n africa mostly at the time .
but there are some additional benefits as well .
collecting global health data was an imp ##er ##fect science : workers tram ##ped through villages to knock on doors and ask questions , wrote the answers on paper forms , then input the data - - and from this gap ##py information , countries would make huge decisions . data gee ##k joel sela ##niki ##o talks through the sea change in collecting health data in the past decade - - starting with the palm pilot and hot ##mai ##l , and now moving into the cloud . & lt ; em & gt ; & lt ; / em & gt ;
and when we drop the ball ##ast over ##board we climb .
throwing over ##board , as ball ##ast , to change our direction .
but we were expected to have doubt ##s ; we ' re expected to have fears .
but it will not be possible in the future any more .
why that ? because fuel is not easy to replace .
and this is exactly the symbol of our world .
but much more , to get advice ##s , to give your comments , to spread the word that if it ' s possible in the air , of course it ' s possible in the ground .
you see , it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song , you needed a studio and a producer .
don ' t ask .
and what we ' re facing in africa is an un ##pre ##ced ##ented threat to human dig ##nity and equality .
you see , it ' s not as dramatic as the tsunami .
don ' t you think that on a pure ##ly commercial level , that anti - retro ##vira ##l drugs are great ad ##vert ##ise ##ments for western ingen ##uit ##y and technology ?
this is the straight truth , the right ##eous truth .
so why , then , are we not pump ##ing our fis ##ts into the air ?
momentum has been building .
there ' s the continent africa .
a few minutes ago , i talk ##ed about all the citizens ' campaigns that are spring ##ing up .
i really believe that old truman line , that if you give the american people the facts , they ' ll do the right thing .
i think we have the money and brain ##s in the room to do that .
now , " all sho ##ok up " is a great love song .
people with colored hearing actually see colors when they hear the sounds of words or letters .
they took longer to re ##ject meta ##ph ##ors as false than they did to re ##ject literally false sentence ##s .

and he said , " you are the bridge . "
pm : and we should point out that he works with you as well at the paper .
we ' ve suffered prosecution ; the paper was closed down more than three times .
actually , that ' s a documentary that ' s available online ; the video ' s online .
as political turm ##oil in yemen continues , the editor of the yemen times , nadia al - sak ##ka ##f , talks at ted ##glo ##bal with host pat mitchell . al - sak ##ka ##f ' s independent , english - language paper is vital for sharing news - - and for sharing a new vision of yemen and of that country ' s women as equal partners in work and change .
my father and my grandfather were always looking for the new ##est thing in alternative or traditional therapie ##s for ph , but after six months , i couldn ' t walk up a small hill . i couldn ' t climb a flight of sta ##irs .
it certainly didn ' t prepare me for what came next .
my doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung trans ##plant .
but organs don ' t wait , and i went into surgery before i could say goodbye .
medical conditions don ' t ne ##gate the human condition .
and many of these chemicals are now linked to the sky ##rock ##etin ##g incidents of chronic childhood disease that we ' re seeing across industrial ##ized nations .
and you can see these large , yol ##ked - up eggs bur ##stin ##g through the surface of this male ' s teste ##s .
but just two weeks before that , the u . s . senate refused to even debate the ban ##ning of bp ##a in bab ##ies ' bottle ##s and si ##ppy cups .
in addition to that , after the baby ' s born , our other unique invention as mammals is that we nou ##rish our offs ##pring after they ' re born .
th : one of this things that ' s ex ##citi ##ng and appropriate for me to be here at ted ##wo ##men is that , well , i think it was sum ##med up best last night at dinner when someone said , " turn to the man at your table and tell them , ' when the revolution starts , we ' ve got your back . ' " the truth is , women , you ' ve had our back on this issue for a very long time , starting with rachel carson ' s " silent spring " to theo col ##born ' s " our stolen future " to sandra stein ##gra ##ber ' s books " living downs ##tream " and " having faith . "
and it ' s my feeling and it ' s my ur ##ging being here to know that , as we women move forward as the commun ##icato ##rs of this , but also as the ones who carry that burden of carrying the children , bearing the children , we hold most of the buying power in the household , is that it ' s going to be us moving forward to carry the work of tyrone and other scientists around the world .
here is a remote island repos ##itor ##y for bottle ##s off the coast of baja california .
that day i ended up spending nearly 60 .
all the king ' s horses and all the king ' s men . . .
but cur ##ious ##ly , red ##wood rain ##for ##est ##s , the fragments that we have left , to this day remain under - explore ##d .
and with a friend of his , he took it upon himself to free - climb a red ##wood without rope ##s or any equipment to see what was up there .
when steve sil ##lett gets up into a big red ##wood , he fires an arrow , which trails a fishing line , which gets over a branch in the tree , and then you as ##cend up a rope which has been drag ##ged into the tree by the line .
this reiter ##ation is a huge flying but ##tres ##s that comes out the tree itself .
they ' re finding out that red ##wood ##s can move mois ##ture out of the air and down into their trunk ##s , possibly all the way into their root systems .
what can the red ##wood ##s tell us about ours ##el ##ves ?
richard preston , thank you very much , i think .
the pc virus problem is 25 years old now .
and you can see at the top of the screen , there ' s a cent ##ipe ##de sc ##roll ##ing across your computer when you get infected by this one .
well there ' s multiple different ways , such as banking tro ##jans , which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking , or key ##log ##gers .
they also use the global nature of internet to their advantage .
and that ' s a back ##do ##or which will take over your computer .
now i ' m not a lawyer , but if i would be , this is where i would say , " i rest my case . "
so prepared ##ness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted aren ' t there .
there are lots of thing that the approach i take can pred ##ic ##t , and there are some that it can ' t .
and many of you may have notice ##d that doesn ' t have as big an effect , as perhaps you would like it to have .
we ' ve increased it to 3 . 6 million .
you might notice what we don ' t need to know : there ' s no history in here .
and down at 100 they would build civilian nuclear energy , which is what they say is their objective .
everything is not pred ##ic ##table : the stock market is , at least for me , not pred ##ic ##table , but most complicated negotiations are pred ##ic ##table .
whether you ' re an artist , a techno ##logist , a lawyer or a fan , the handling of copyright directly impacts your life .

sata ##wal is one half - mile long by one mile wide .
this is part of our collective narrative .
it ' s the most important map of all .
you don ' t work in your self - interest all the time , because when emotion comes into it , the wir ##ing changes in the way it functions .
so , i ' ve had an interesting laboratory to try to answer the question of the real question , which is what ' s the difference in somebody ' s life if you look at somebody like those people that you ' ve given everything to ? like all the resources they say they need . you gave them not a 100 - dollar computer ; you gave them the best computer . you gave them love ; you gave them joy . you were there to comfort them .
the defini ##ng factor is never resources ; it ' s resource ##ful ##ness .
hon ##est ##ly , better or worse ? say , " ay ##e . "
your model of the world is the filter . that ' s what ' s sha ##ping us .
how many of you here love surprise ##s ? say , " ay ##e . "
if nothing else works for you , get a dog . don ' t get a cat . get a dog , because if you leave for two minutes , it ' s like you ' ve been gone for six months when you show back up again five minutes later , right ?
now , 18 years later , i ' m proud to tell you , last year we fed two million people in 35 countries through our foundation , all during the holidays : thanks ##gi ##ving , christmas - - - - in all the different countries around the world .
she said , " it ' s over . " when i finished that night , she called him and left a message - - true story - - at the top of the world trade center where he worked , saying , " honey , i love you , i just want you to know i want to marry you . it was stu ##pid of me . " she was asl ##eep , because it was 3 a . m . for us , when he called her back from the top and said , " honey , i can ' t tell you what this means . "
and that was largely because there were ##n ' t any .
and we define ours ##el ##ves by our gap ##s .
any dot can be click ##ed and expanded . and we see here , " i would just feel so much better if i could cur ##l up in his arms right now and feel his affect ##ion for me in the em ##bra ##ce of his body and the tender ##ness of his lips . "
the next movement is called mob ##s .
here we see people that feel " slip ##ping , " " nau ##se ##ous , " " responsible . "
this is in response to , what ' s beautiful ? " miss world . "
it ' s called universe : reveal ##ing our modern mythology .
we can click on one of those and have the photograph be the center of the universe .
here we have our star field . here we have our shape ##s .
but i think they ' re beautiful , don ' t you ?
what would that mean ? i have no idea .
this looks like a series of breaking waves , and it ' s caused by shea ##ring winds - - the wind above the cloud layer and below the cloud layer differ significantly , and in the middle , in between , you get this und ##ulat ##ing of the air , and if the difference in those speed ##s is just right , the tops of the und ##ulation ##s cur ##l over in these beautiful breaking wave - like vor ##tice ##s .
the sharp , cr ##is ##p outline ##s of this formation make it the best one for finding shape ##s in .
let ' s go back a few years in time and see what happened back then .
using computers , even though they ' re getting faster and better all the time , it ' s a challenge to deal with gi ##gab ##yte ##s of data , tera ##by ##tes of data and extra ##cting the relevant information .
you can see that there is [ a ] sc ##atte ##ring of x - rays on the teeth , the metal in the teeth .
and again , it ' s fully interactive , so you can rota ##te and you can look at things in real time on these systems here .
it really just works like a huge iphone .
and to take that even further , this is a heart .
so mot ##ts is doing something here , and probably he is going like this with his right hand , because the left side is activated on the motor cortex .
i can peel off the layer of the lion .
and so it was simply aston ##ishing to me to find an organization that actually app ##rec ##iate ##d both those sides .
he said , " ok . i measured the height of a brick .
the standard explanation is that the universe some ##how sp ##rang into existence , full of a strange kind of energy - - inflation ##ary energy - - which ble ##w it up .
the density of matter is finite , and we have a chance of a consistent set of equations that can describe the whole process .
and the next map now shows africa ' s gdp in 1960 , around the time of independence for many african states .
and to my aston ##ish ##ment , they backed me 100 percent .
everyone lives together in this hotel - - lecturer ##s and students - - and it ' s not sur ##pris ##ing at all to find an imp ##rom ##pt ##u tutor ##ial at 1 a . m .
i will be attending aims .
i want to point out a few other exceptional people in this picture .
and our partners across africa are extremely ent ##hus ##ias ##tic about this .
when computers were first introduced , they were said to be a million times faster than neu ##rons .
and let me just summa ##riz ##e . so the bottom line : the brain processes information using 100 , 000 times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have .
now , what ' s happen ##ing is that as trans ##istor ##s are getting smaller and smaller and smaller , they no longer be ##hav ##e like this .
ok , so a computer pick ##s a specific item of data from memory , it sends it into the processor or the al ##u , and then it puts the result back into memory .
this is kare ##em ' s dark eyes and that ' s the white background that you see here .
i was coming at it from a different perspective , where i was bringing that different perspective to bear on the problem .
so , despite the fact that i ' m going to talk to you about an object that ' s super ##mas ##sive , and i ' m going to get to what that really means in a moment , it has no finite size .
i need to understand the mass of the object i ' m claiming is a black hole , and what its schwarz ##schi ##ld radius is .
so , at the center there , that ' s actually where most of the star ##light comes out from .
which is the job that i have to show you today .
you ' re seeing an animation that goes between an example of what you would see if you don ' t use this technique - - in other words , just a picture that shows the stars - - and the box is centered on the center of the galaxy , where we think the black hole is .
and because of that , we ' ve been able to show that there is a super ##mas ##sive black hole there .
in fact , we antic ##ip ##ated that star formation should ##n ' t proc ##eed in that environment .
and i hope , if nothing else , i ' ve convinced you that , one , we do in fact have a super ##mas ##sive black hole at the center of the galaxy .
and how people get this music , how it comes into their lives , really fas ##cina ##tes me .
but the way we rea ##ct to different combination ##s of these phenomena is complex and emotional and not totally understood .
but every musician strikes a different balance between faith and reason , inst ##in ##ct and intelligence .
it ' s the time in which the big forms began to aris ##e .
the culture in which we live now is aw ##ash with music of imp ##rov ##isation that ' s been sl ##ice ##d , dice ##d , layer ##ed and , god knows , distributed and sold .
and it ex ##cite ##s me now to meet people who are hi ##kers , chefs , code writers , taxi drivers , people i never would have gu ##esse ##d who loved the music and who are passing it on .
the real key observation he made is that a free - flying wing can sw ##eep through more sky and generate more power in a unit of time than a fixed - wing turbine .

it felt like a revolution .
it ' s based on hundreds of hours of research , of practice .
it ' s by giving away what you think is your deep ##est secret that maybe millions of people are em ##power ##ed to help improve it .
but what ' s key here is , the reason these groups have been able to connect is because their work output is of the type that can be easily shared digital ##ly - - a picture , a music file , software .
there ' s a problem with a traditional scientific paper .
it ' s right here .
schools can ' t be sil ##os .
the same tras ##h site is feeding more than 30 families .
now , to make this more concrete , let ' s look at the list of top 10 words that statistical ##ly stick out in the most favorite ted ##tal ##ks and in the least favorite ted ##tal ##ks .
and analysis shows if you want to be among the most favorite ted speakers , you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average , make sure you wear your glass ##es and be slightly more dressed - up than the average ted speaker .
so i ' m going to take as inspiration the fact that we ' re all interested in intera ##cting with other people , i ' m going to completely strip it of all its comp ##lica ##ting features , and i ' m going to turn that object , that simplified object , into a scientific probe , and provide the early stages , em ##bry ##onic stages of new insight ##s into what happens in two brain ##s while they simultaneously intera ##ct .

right now , here we are linked up to long beach and every ##w ##here else , and all these secret locations for a fraction of that cost , and we can send and receive huge quant ##ities of information without it costi ##ng anything .

some teachers are far more effective than others .
you can ' t really dispute what you see on the video , and there is a lot to be learned from that , and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession when we actually get to see this .
that ' s understand ##able , but our experience with met suggests that if teachers manage the process , if they collect video in their own classroom ##s , and they pick the lessons they want to sub ##mit , a lot of them will be ea ##ger to participate .
it ' s a movement that - - it advocate ##s making bio ##technology accessible to everyone , not just scientists and people in government labs .

these drugs were brought to market . they were pres ##cribed very widely because heart attacks are a very common thing , and it took so long for us to find out that these drugs also caused an increased rate of death that before we det ##ected that safety signal , over 100 , 000 people died un ##nec ##essa ##rily in america from the pres ##cript ##ion of anti - ar ##rh ##yth ##mic drugs .

in zimbabwe , for example , there were just about a dozen ps ##ych ##iat ##rist ##s , most of whom lived and worked in hara ##re city , leaving only a couple to address the mental health care needs of nine million people living in the countryside .

how should we really honor fe ##yn ##man ?

and so , going back to this aba ##lone shell , besides being nano - structure ##d , one thing that ' s fas ##cina ##ting , is when a male and a female aba ##lone get together , they pass on the genetic information that says , " this is how to build an ex ##quis ##ite material .
the aba ##lone shell here - - and if you frac ##ture it , you can look at the fact that it ' s nano - structure ##d .

and then you ' ll hear things like the train , a plane , a car - - so , the com ##mut ##e .
and what you find is that , especially with creative people - - designers , programmer ##s , writers , engineers , think ##ers - - that people really need long stretch ##es of uni ##nter ##rupted time to get something done .
why do we ex ##pect people to work well if they ' re being inter ##rupted all day at the office ?
that ' s kind of rid ##icu ##lou ##s . it ' s a total deco ##y .
i mean , what are the chances that all 10 people are ready to stop ?
because the offices are well equipped , everything should be there for them to do their work , but they don ' t want to go there right now , so how do we change that ?
you can quit i . m . ; you can ' t hide your manager .

it brings rudi ##mentar ##y banking services to places where there ' s no banking infrastructure .
like , this is via ##gra that i bought from a back ##stre ##et sex shop in china .
for me , this kind of personi ##fies this connected world , where everything is inter ##tw ##ined , and the dot ##s are - - it ' s all about the dot ##s joining together .
and , with that , comes the third point , which is obligation - - and an obligation to that availability .
our reality right now is less interesting than the story we ' re going to tell about it later .
what were we just talking about ?

sometimes they assume i am deaf .
a guy goes into a ps ##ych ##iat ##rist .
so what can we do ?
other examples you can see here are from latvia , lithuania , estonia - - the central european countries .
so first you ask a big question : why we do it ? what is the goal ?
you will recall that in 1976 , june 16 , the students of south africa boy ##cott ##ed the language of afrikaans as the medium of the opp ##resso ##r , as they were sort of like really told that they must do everything in afrikaans - - biology , mathematics - - and what about our languages ?
she ended up under ##nea ##th the car .
and i ended up with a plastic nose , por ##cela ##in teeth and all kinds of other things .
so they eventually started match ##ing their talents and skills to all of my needs .
so i moved on from there .
and as a blind person , your visual memory fa ##des and is replaced with how you feel about things and how things sound and how things sm ##ell .
and he wrote to the academic ##ians in paris , trying to explain his theory .
and i think galileo sum ##med up , very nice ##ly , the power of mathematics to understand the scientific world around us .
but i wanted to try and enric ##h him .
so i ' m going to take you through , perhaps push you a little bit mathematical ##ly - - so brace yours ##el ##ves - - push you a little bit to understand how this language works , which enable ##s us to capture what is sy ##mme ##try .
so both of these objects have six sy ##mme ##trie ##s .
let ' s do a rotation by a third of a turn antic ##lock ##wise , and reflect in the line through x .
but the shape ##s match up if i rota ##te by a sixth of a turn around the point where all the triangle ##s meet .
well , unfortunately it isn ' t really a picture . if i could have my board at the side here , great , excellent .
two ? so you should have sat down earlier .
i ' ve learned that they ' re really the essence of what makes for progress , even when they seem to be terrible .
but i think from the point of view of a nea ##ndert ##hal , there would have been a lot of disa ##pp ##rova ##l of the wim ##pis ##h cho ##pper ##s that we now have .
and mark twain , who knew all about types ##etting , really was sm ##itten by this machine .
and my favorite example of that occurred beginning in 1976 , when it was discovered that the bacteria causing legion ##naires disease had always been present in natural waters , but it was the precise temperature of the water in heat ##ing , venti ##lati ##ng and air condition ##ing systems that raised the right temperature for the maximum reproduction of legion ##ella bac ##illus .
think of the financial world , for example .
for some reason , there ' s no standard sy ##lla ##bus , there ' s no basic course .
here ' s something that drives me crazy .
you get it every time .
and instead of that point and click , it ' s like a push and pull , things coll ##ide as you ' d ex ##pect them . just like on my real desk , i can - - let me just grab these guys - - i can turn things into pile ##s instead of just the fold ##ers that we have .
i think you can really enric ##h the way we bro ##ws ##e our photographs and bring it to that kind of shoe ##box of , you know , photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing .
let me introduce you to my brand new project , " baroque in rock , " which became a golden disc most recently .
they acquire the sens ##ibility of truth because they repeat over and over again , and they oss ##ify and cal ##ci ##fy , and they become real .
and i said , " what ' s the black box for wall street ? "
and the ga ##g is that , of course , these aren ' t just running through the market .
and the thing is , is that this isn ' t google .
we ' re design ##ing for this machine dialect .
it involves light cone ##s and quantum enta ##ng ##lement , and i don ' t really understand any of that .
this much , right ?
js : cuts itself .
fifty percent of crash ##es happen at intersection ##s .
add that together with the gas , and it ' s $ 112 , 000 per year , just for that sign in each direction .
when people come to an un ##fam ##ilia ##r situation they don ' t know how to deal with they slow down .
for example , mea ##sle ##s was four million of the deaths back as recently as 1990 and now is under 400 , 000 .
and more recently you can see it ' s just around the e ##qua ##tor .
and that ' s where we saw the malaria map shri ##nki ##ng .
i can say that , even though i ' m a college drop - out .
so , how do you make education better ?
you might think these are people with master ' s degrees .
and the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public schools .
and that allows us to understand who ' s doing it well , and call them out , and find out what those techniques are .
you know , the system doesn ' t naturally make it happen .
the first em ##bra ##ce is something that we think , " oh , this is very easy , " but it ' s actually getting harder , and that ' s paying attention to the world around us .
i was to the point where i was using a stop ##watch and painting square ##s out of random ##ness , and i wasn ' t getting anywhere . so i went back and dum ##ped all my paintings in the arno , and i thought , i ' m going to just start playing around .
i ' ll find a way to get in , because i don ' t want to see this history disa ##ppe ##ar . "
how many of you are completely comfort ##able with calling yours ##el ##ves a leader ?
" and i felt so bad for this dud ##e that i took the lo ##lli ##pop , and as soon as i did , you got this inc ##redi ##bly severe look on your face and you looked at my mom and my dad , and you said , ' look at that . look at that .
we need to get over it so we can move beyond it , and our little brothers and our little sisters , and one day our kids - - or our kids right now - - can watch and start to value the impact we can have on each other ' s lives more than money and power and titles and influence .
so nowa ##days in the operating room , we no longer need to use sun ##light .
so if you ' ve sent three specimens , it ' s an hour later .
the molecule passes through and gets ex ##cre ##ted .
and then if that node has cancer , the woman would go on to get the ax ##illa ##ry ly ##mp ##h node disse ##ction .
in the setting of prost ##ate cancer , up to 60 percent of men after prost ##ate cancer surgery may have uri ##nar ##y inc ##ont ##inen ##ce and ere ##ct ##ile dis ##fu ##nc ##tion .
so here ' s a tumor .
i ' d like to leave you with this final thought .
and this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about .
but electricity also will go in all directions - - the path of least resistance , which is where that phrase , in part , comes from .
and because it ' s a protein , it ' s en ##code ##d for in the dna of this organi ##sm .
so if we could figure out what cells they are , we could maybe find new targets for which drugs could be designed or screen ##ed against , or maybe places where electro ##des could be put in for people who have very severe disability .
and the animal ' s going to hear a tone - - and a flash of light occurred there .
maybe 100 , 000 people have coc ##hle ##ar imp ##lant ##s , which allow them to hear .
and the goal , of course , of this maz ##e is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that ' s under the lit top port .
and by turning things off , it ' s more or less a zero .
and we also sample ##d the outdoor air .
thank you .
there were no cars , so it seemed even better , in some ways .
so it ' s been a very op ##timi ##stic time , i think , and i want to just talk about a few of those things .
this is what they think about my site ; it ' s ranked by blog authority .
so basica ##lly , the number of pages that mention this term , that also mention this page , the percentage of those pages is that person ' s google share of that term .
they ' re talking about slavery in 1860 .
if you ' re the second site there , most people link to you .
we are increasingly offered a diet in which sensation , not story , is king .
and the speed with which they associate it with " sl ##um ##dog million ##aire " or the fa ##vela ##s in rio speaks to the end ##uring nature .
and the stories they held provided a shared experience .
these films held what was too hurt ##ful to say out loud , and they became more useful to me than the w ##his ##pers of survivors and the occasional gli ##mps ##e of a tatt ##oo on a maiden aunt ' s wr ##ist .
can opera be ever - so - slightly sexy ? the gl ##orio ##us soprano danielle de nie ##se shows how , singing the fl ##irt ##y " meine lippe ##n , sie kus ##sen so he ##iss . " which , translated , means , as you might gu ##ess : " i kiss so hot . " from giu ##dit ##ta by frans le ##har ; acc ##om ##pani ##st : ingrid surge ##nor .
commerce , on the other hand , is relatively quick , essentially creative , highly effective and efficient , and fundamental ##ly hon ##est , because we can ' t exchange value for very long if we don ' t trust each other .
so we ' ve designed products and we anal ##y ##zed chemicals down to the parts per million .
the upper is ny ##lon 6 that can go back to cap ##rol ##ac ##tam , the bottom , a pol ##yol ##ep ##hine - - infinite ##ly rec ##yc ##lab ##le the ##rm ##op ##lasti ##c .
when asked , they said , " it ' s kind of like a giant toile ##t that doesn ' t fl ##ush . "
and we have pl ##enty of energy , so we ' ll solve that problem , but the biology problem ' s trick ##y , because as we put through all these toxic materials that we dis ##gor ##ge , we will never be able to recover that .
shoes for nike , where the upper ##s are pol ##yes ##ters , infinite ##ly rec ##yc ##lab ##le , the bottom ##s are bio ##deg ##rada ##ble soles .
because if they to ##xi ##fy themselves , being the lowest - cost producer , send it to the lowest - cost distribution - - wal - mart - - and then we send them all our money , what we ' ll discover is that we have what , effectively , when i was a student , was called mutual ##ly assure ##d destruction .
and then the comp ##ost is all taken back to the roof ##s of the city , where we ' ve got farming , because what we ' ve done is lift ##ed up the city , the landscape , into the air to - - to restore the native landscape on the roof ##s of the buildings .
this is five times larger .
we didn ' t know about x ##key ##sco ##re . we didn ' t know about cyber ##tra ##ns .
yet we have these files .
all right , how many swedish decision ##makers and politicians and business leaders use , every day , u . s . - based services , like , you know , run windows or os ##x , or use facebook or linked ##in , or store their data in clouds like ic ##lou ##d or sky ##drive or drop ##box , or maybe use online services like amazon web services or sales support ?
and who ##ever tells you that they have nothing to hide simply has ##n ' t thought about this long enough .
she was one of the targets of nsa surveillance .
humans have long held a fas ##cina ##tion for the human brain .
and what you can see is it ' s very non - uniform . you see a lot more structure there .
we get one from mom , one from dad .
and in seattle , we take these - - this is a whole human hemisphere - - and we put them into what ' s basica ##lly a gl ##ori ##fied meat sl ##ice ##r .
you can see on the micro ##scope slide here , that ' s what ' s happen ##ing in real time .
green is the sort of cool areas where it ' s not turned on .
so if you ' re in drug discovery , for example , you can go through an entire listing of what the genome has on offer to find perhaps better drug targets and op ##timi ##ze .
these aren ' t sc ##hi ##zo ##ph ##reni ##c individuals , but they do show some population variation .
so why is that ?
the thing is , if we don ' t know whether we are doing any good , we are not any better than the medieval doctors and their lee ##ches .
" if you give the nets for free , people are not going to value them .
that ' s bad , but there are places like that .
and then you make it easy and give a reason to act now by adding a kilo of lent ##ils for each im ##mun ##ization .
the third one is important because if we think people get used to hand ##outs , it might destroy markets to dis ##tri ##but ##e free bed nets .
you know how to im ##mun ##ize kids , you know how to give bed nets . "
tell people the benefits of education , that ' s very cheap to do .
but look what we just did today .
and now , maybe , we can go back to the bigger question that i started with at the beginning .
we ' ve all heard these things .
and that has to do with me because in 1994 , i pack ##ed a few things into a back ##pac ##k and headed off for a year of travel in the middle of my university career .
so let ' s start shed ##ding light on this amazing ec ##lec ##tic continent that has so much to offer .
so the very definition - - to say " in ##vest in africa " is a no - go .
but looking at goldman sachs ' work - - we had the famous br ##ic report .
the announcement just came out the last few weeks .
it ' s more expensive to transport goods . prices of goods go up , inflation is affected .
it ' s the 24 - hour rolling african news channel .
it also provides a third of the food we eat .
we so rarely look at the sky .
so this is the footage that i was showing everybody .
oka ##y .
so this is the footage he photograph ##ed , and it was pretty moving and pretty aw ##e - ins ##pi ##ring .
it was , incident ##ally , the last time i ever saw day ##light .
and he said , " because no one knows you had anything to do with it . "
how could somebody read using their finger ##tip ##s ?
kt : no .
kb : just don ' t break my concentration .
i need two people to help me out real quick .
ok , now , do you believe in witch ##craft at all ?
kb : what did you feel ?
ok , now , allow it to stay there .
and hold it there , hold it there , both of you , hold it there .
come right over here , next to me .
and i want you to release that negative energy by sha ##king it from side to side .
you knew !
they ' ll keep an eye on me to make sure i don ' t do anything funny .
sj : you ' re over a cup .
do you think the spike is under your left hand , or under your right hand ?
that ' s not good . hi . yeah . real bad . don ' t even look at me .
you know that when you have those abu ##sive voices , all those little neu ##rons get together and in that little gap you get a real toxic " i want to kill myself " kind of chemical , and if you have that over and over again on a loop tape , you might have yourself depression .
we are not equipped for the 21st century .
we need to know why people are doing what they ' re doing .
but it was testa ##bly stu ##pid .
and in that pair , one person gets a message saying , " do you want to give up some of your $ 10 you earned for being here and ship it to someone else in the lab ? "
so to make the experiment , i knew i ' d have to go into the brain and mani ##pula ##te o ##xy ##toc ##in directly .
so if i do something that hurt ##s you , i feel that pain .
tell that guy to wait half an hour .
now there are other ways the system can be in ##hi ##bit ##ed .
the bride .
so there ' s tons of ways that we can connect to other people , and it seems to be universal .
i tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools , where did it come from ?
and you have people who guide those computers to do their cle ##rical jobs .
one of your students must have been passing by , showed them how to use the mouse . "
there ' s one community of children in southern india whose english pronuncia ##tion is really bad , and they needed good pronuncia ##tion because that would improve their jobs .
i came back after two months and the children troop ##ed in and said , " we ' ve understood nothing . "
kal ##liku ##ppa ##m had caught up with my control school in new delhi , a rich private school with a trained bio ##technology teacher .
the rep ##tilia ##n part of our brain , which sits in the center of our brain , when it ' s threatened , it shut ##s down everything else , it shut ##s down the pre ##fronta ##l cortex , the parts which learn , it shut ##s all of that down .
you can ' t catch me .
you already heard about that . you know what that means .
it ' s a facility which is practical ##ly un ##mann ##ed .
i ' ll play at these rock shows , be on stage standing completely still , and they ' re like , " what ' s she doing ? ! what ' s she doing ? ! "
if i pass out on the next song . . .
this quand ##ary led to the title of the project , which considers in many ways that we are all the living dead and that we in some ways represent ghosts of the past and the future .
and i found these maps which you see here .
so they ' re testing its viru ##len ##ce .
everyone showed up .
tensions between these two families date back to 1913 when there was a dispute over local political power .
this is just an ab ##ridge ##d rende ##ring of over a thousand images .
there ' s nothing too difficult about the piece .
and you feel really quite - - believe it or not - - det ##ached from the instrument and from the stick , even though i ' m actually holding the stick quite tight ##ly .
they ' re all different .
exactly . because i ' m not even touch ##ing it .
in a year ' s time , it could be two extra steps .
however , not one of you got out of your seats to think , " right ! how can i cl ##ap ? ok , maybe . . .
and interesting ##ly , the older i became , and when i became a full - time student at a so called " music institution , " all of that went out of the window .
in this soa ##ring demonstration , deaf percussioni ##st evelyn glenn ##ie ill ##ust ##rates how listening to music involves much more than simply lett ##ing sound waves hit your ear ##dru ##ms .
and it got big enough to the point where there was a fl ##oat last year at the mac ##y ' s thanks ##gi ##ving day parade , and rick as ##tle ##y pop ##s out , and rick ##roll ##s millions of people on television .
but that ' s not what ' s interesting about this .
got a couple questions for you .
but there were some good things that came out of that too .
and they were probably please ##d to see you on top of the time poll .
dinosaur evolution proceeded at a state ##ly pace , an order of magnitude slow ##er on any way you want to measure it .
a three - and - a - half foot thing , beautiful skull , predator , meat - eat ##er , a two - legge ##d animal .
your job as a leader - - this is definit ##ely a team sport - - your job as a leader is to try to inspire them to do more work than they ' ve ever done in their life under conditions that they can ' t imagine .
it turns out to have a fore ##bra ##in one - fifteen ##th the size of a human .
somebody get the front legs .
and then work later is going to take us to tibet .
now we have dive ##rgen ##ce over time , but we ' ve created the third dimension of area .
they ' re really kind ##red disciplines .
you have to have those steps . if you have - - it ' s easy to get kids interested in science .
you give her a quick crack in the teeth with your el ##bow and blaze for the finish line .
they ' re not doing 26 miles ; they ' re doing 100 , 150 miles at a time , and apparently without injury , without problems .
there ' s not a fast woman on the planet and there never has been .
so about seven years , eight years to reach your peak , and then gradually you fall off your peak , until you go back to the starting point .
you need a pack to pull together .
and what happened was we started creating these fan ##cy cu ##shi ##oned things , which can make running " better , " called running shoes .
but maybe there ' s another benefit there as well .
for me , that was the white space ; that ' s what robots could not do yet .
he ' s a scar ##y monster .
you call your friend , she puts her hands ##et in a robot , and , bam ! you ' re a me ##bot - - you can make eye contact , you can talk with your friends , you can move around , you can ges ##ture - - maybe the next best thing to really being there , or is it ?
i imagine a time not too far from now - - my mom can go to her computer , open up a browser and jack into a little robot .
to explore that question , we did a study in the boston area where we put one of three intervention ##s in people ' s homes for a period of several weeks .
but we can push this idea further .
robots touch something deeply human within us .
and i can ' t have my posse lau ##ghi ##n ' at me .
and i followed this guy every ##w ##here until i had him in the room , and i read him one of my pieces , and you know what he told me ?
i can master shock of " the cry ##ing game " with the aw ##e of a child being called an aids victim by a bull ##y who didn ' t know that it was his father who gave it to my mother , and that ' s a double entendre .
i then went on wonder ##ing whether i could actually replace her image , so i got a look - ali ##ke of diana and pose ##d her in the right positions and angles and created something that was in , or existed in , the public imagination .
well , here is the image .
so , all this work is getting shown in art galleries .
this image is quite interesting , actually , because i think we made it three years ago .
what jack nicholson might be up to in his celebrity life , and the fact that he tried to . . . he had a bit of road rage and golf - club ##bed a driver the other day .
has anyone here wonder ##ed what will happen if you go back to your room at night , and you start getting chest pain ##s , short ##ness of breath , sw ##eat ##ing ?
that is something to keep in mind . we can ' t deal with it with situations like this .
we have 25 positions right now - - all of them trained , board certified in the usa , canada or britain .
and we will do other centers .
they need to be alive , they need to feed .
we ' re also starting anc ##illa ##ry health - care technology training programs - - training people in echo ##card ##io ##graphy , card ##iac ultra ##sou ##nd , those kinds of things . now , with that kind of training , it gives people motivation .
and i actually feel at home here , because there ' s a lot of aut ##ism genetics here .
my drawings got to star in the movie too .
and the way i sold livestock jobs is i showed off my drawings , i showed off pictures of things .
i was really concerned about having to wear this gad ##get on my face .
i find a lot of people have difficulty doing that .
he was now dr . carlo ##ck in the movie .
and when i was 13 , i had a job at a dress ##maker ' s shop se ##wing clothes .
because what i ' m ob ##ser ##ving is the good teachers , for a lot of these kids , are out in the community colleges , but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools .
what are you most passion ##ate about ?
now my own speciali ##ty is combining digital technology and magic .
bye - bye .
and it was deep . it was deep in my soul .
now there ' s a talent un ##to itself .
and now the shore is coming , and there ' s just a little part of me that ' s sad .
thank you .
the first problem is there ' s ina ##de ##quate disaster response .
they send him to iraq .
i think it ' s very important , because right now somebody needs to step up , and this generation of veterans has the opportunity to do that if they are given the chance .
what would this lead to ?
and so they invented the scientific journal as a way of syn ##ch ##roni ##zing the argument across the community of natural scientists .
the programmer ##s come and go .
this has the following effect : a programmer in edinburgh and a programmer in ente ##bbe can both get the same - - a copy of the same piece of software .
right .
it was the ex ##pect ##ation of the citizens that she would not be censo ##red .
this one i thought i ' d show you .
morgan hen ##dry : be ##ware of safety is an instrumental rock band .
so we literally are all made out of star ##dust .
and if you look at the top left , you see a little teen ##y dark dot .
oka ##y , we have parachute align ##ed .
bc : we enter the marti ##an atmosphere .
that ' s when we separate from the back shell , and we ' re now in free - fall .
then we get a little bit more serious , so we have what we call our cad / cam ##s and all the engineers who are involved , or scientists who are involved , who know about thermal properties , know about design , know about atmospheric interaction , parachute ##s , all of these things , which they work in a team effort and actually design a spacecraft in a computer to some extent , so to see , does that meet the requirement that we need .
but also , if there is something that we cannot reach because it is too high on a cliff , we have a little laser system which will actually za ##p the rock , eva ##pora ##te some of it , and actually anal ##y ##ze what ' s coming from that rock .
so as we flew by away from it , we looked back . and gu ##ess what ?
you just drive to the nearest lake , stick your hos ##e in it , and you ' ve got your car filled up .
so if we start to think expo ##nenti ##ally , we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us .
we have the ability to do more powerful things with them .
and of course , there ' s an app for that .
you can twee ##t your weight to your friends , and they can keep you in line .
how about aug ##menti ##ng the physician ?
so a few examples : we ' re now in the era of " fantastic voyage , " the ip ##ill .
in genomics now , the genome cost about a billion dollars about 10 years ago when the first one came out .
we can be prevent ##ative ; that prevention can be personal ##ized ; and more important ##ly , it ' s going to become increasingly participat ##ory .
we ' ve been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about 15 years to approach a whole range of topics , particularly in card ##io ##vas ##cular disease .
the first one is dedicated to spencer , and his grandmother , who was shock ##ed by his work .
in those days there was still countryside close to the city , farms , corn ##field ##s , cow ##s ; even not far from our building with its blu ##rre ##d brick and long shadow ##y hall ##way you could find tract ##s with hills and trees you could prete ##nd were mountains and forests .
the girl , my old love , the last lost time i saw her when she came to find me at a party , her drunk ##en ##ly stu ##mb ##ling , falling , spraw ##ling , ski ##rt hi ##ked , eyes vei ##ned red , sw ##olle ##n with tears , her shame , her dish ##onor .
this is called " thi ##rst . "
a casu ##al impulse , a fan ##cy , never thought of until now , hard ##ly thought of even now . . .
the girls , to my horror , aver ##ted their gaz ##e .
c . k . williams : poetry of youth and age
samuel pisa ##r , an auschwitz survivor , said , and i ' ll quote him , " the holocaust teach ##es us that nature , even in its cruel ##est moments , is beni ##gn in comparison with man , when he lose ##s his moral comp ##ass and his reason . "
but images don ' t need to be graphic in order to remi ##nd us of the tragedy of war .
what we ' re going to try and do today , in the 16 and a bit minutes i ' ve got left , is to try and answer three questions . the first one is , why ?
that was our hf radio antenna .
two norwegian ##s did it as a team in 2000 . no one ' s done it solo .
when the ice was flat or flat ##tis ##h , i could just about pull both .
some pretty radical technology , a radical approach - - but it worked perfect ##ly .
i took a photo of that . sat down on my sl ##ed ##ge . did a sort of video diary piece .
i thought , it ' ll have to do .
this is probably why i didn ' t get into trouble about the length of my airs ##tri ##p .
since then , no one has ever ski ##ed - - this was 93 years ago - - since then , no one has ever ski ##ed from the coast of antarctica to the pole and back .
but i was still concerned , so i said , " you know what , i ' m not going to do it . "
and i remembered that the old and drunk ##en guy came one day to the lab want ##ing to make some easy cash and this was the guy .
i do want to leave you with one positive thought .
but what if we looked at fear in a fresh way ?
these were the fears that dance ##d in the imagination ##s of these poor men , and as it turned out , the fear they chose to listen to would govern whether they lived or died .
what would happen to our minds ?
the novelist vladimir na ##bok ##ov said that the best reader has a combination of two very different temp ##era ##ments , the artistic and the scientific .
i ' m 43 years old right now .
therefore , they asked their parents to go down to the streets and collect them , bring them back home .
and while this was the major difference between many initiatives before to create change , before we thought , and governments told us - - and even sometimes it was true - - that change was imposed on us , and people rejected that , because they thought that it is alien to their culture .
i remember one night when someone phone ##d me on my cell ##phone - - ordinary person who i don ' t know - - from ta ##hr ##ir square .
is this a story - of - the - year , a story - of - the - decade or something more ?
they ' ve had some speakers there .
and frankie says , " i ' m number 22 in line , and i can see the need ##le coming down towards me , and there is blood all over the place .
you don ' t want to share a need ##le any ##more than you want to share a tooth ##bru ##sh even with someone you ' re sleeping with .
so what we ' ve been doing in the united states is review ##ing the data - - endless ##ly review ##ing the data .
they are gay men on the party scene who have , on average , three times more partners than straight people on the party scene .
but it is changing the equation of what ' s rational in sexual decision - making .
what does that mean ?
there are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet , and that ' s one of the gl ##orie ##s of human existence .
and i ' d pull her out on the front por ##ch .
it ' s called cl ##aw - hammer style , that he had learned from his mother and grandmother .
it sounds something like this .
we were standing on the edge of thousands of acres of cotton .
now , my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work .
good news : char ##iot ' s coming .
but then , when i thought about it beyond that , it was very simple things .
and we moved across the street from michael and john whitney .
they said they were going to beat us up if we didn ' t make some gun ##pow ##der for them .
so let me put them all together . and also , i can change the sounds by step ##ping on this pedal right here , and - - let me just close out here by doing you a little ham ##bone solo or something like this .
not only is there a relationship between the ethics of science and the ethics of being a citizen in democracy , but there has been , historically , a relationship between how people think about space and time , and what the cosmos is , and how people think about the society that they live in .
and mer ##ging them together to make the final quantum theory of space and time and gravity , is the cu ##lmi ##nation of that , something that ' s going on right now .
now , darwin taught us that there are processes of self - organization that su ##ffi ##ce to explain all of us and everything we see .
in fact , i ' m finished . science will never go away .
i can see my work as a job . i do it for money .
so i looked for furniture .
he can seat , throughout the year , he can seat 8 , 000 people .
what came out of it ?
there is a full - blow ##n orchestra living inside the building .
these are some pictures visitors sent to me .
and the monkey ##s in that monkey forest looked , actually , fairly happy .
so even as we share death as a universal experience , it ' s not experienced the same way the world over .
and it ' s also a moment of self - awareness .
but i see something prof ##oun ##dl ##y transforma ##tive in ex ##peri ##enci ##ng death as a social process and not just a biological one .
one of the - - thank you for in ##viti ##ng us .
but you do meet some fantastic people , people who look at the world in a totally different way .
" i ' m sorry . i ' ve only got 18 minutes , 18 minutes to talk about saving the world , saving the planet , global institutions .
why would you do that ? why would - - it ' s like one step up from rep ##lying to one of those email ##s from nigeria , isn ' t it ?
but we have a new hope . we have a new man .
and he spoke to the crowd in chicago , he said , " if there is anyone out there who still doubt ##s that america is a place where all things are possible . . . "
do you remember that ? george bush , " a nu - ca - ler . "
" i was held in prison for nearly 30 years on an island in the middle of the ocean .
and there ' s lots of different shape ##s .
and so every time they found something that looked a little different , they named it something different .
they don ' t like it if you come in and want to saw them open and look inside .
so people were looking at these and they were talking about how different they are .
what ' s interesting is the spike on the back of the dra ##core ##x was growing very fast as well .
and then , because the juvenile ##s are in my collection , i cut them open and look inside .
here ' s another one .
now as you can imagine , this is not very popular with fourth - grade ##rs .
and it ' s a resp ##ons ##ive system that ' s trained on actual weather .
any ##way , moving along .
so , un ##fold ##ed it ' s about 300 linear feet .
the view is denied in the galleries where we receive just natural light , and then exposed again in the north gallery with a pan ##ora ##mic view .
wait a minute , it ' s just in that state , we have a long way to go .
and this is a moc ##kup that is in salt lake city that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full - scale .
even in stories on gender - based violence , men get an over ##w ##hel ##ming majority of print space and air ##time .
what she found was many of these stories tend to blame victims and deva ##lue their lives .
putting them there made them more rec ##og ##ni ##za ##ble .
she was the cbs news correspondent who was brutal ##ly sexual ##ly assault ##ed in egypt ' s ta ##hr ##ir square right after this photo was taken .
the botanical names are in front of you .
" be the change you want to see in the world , " said maha ##tma gandhi .
pm : so is this a good idea .
and so that happened more at various times , but i really think that there was a great advantage in many ways to being a woman .
so being an american , i decided to set up a cau ##cus .
the other thing that i think is really important : a lot of national security policy isn ' t just about foreign policy , but it ' s about budget ##s , military budget ##s , and how the debt ##s of countries work out .
so , yeah .
great news . it drives me nuts that most people don ' t seem to know this news .
now i know that some of you think this progress is all in asia or latin america or model countries like brazil - - and who doesn ' t love a brazilian model ? - - but look at sub - sahara ##n africa .
right now today , in oslo as it happens , oil companies are fighting to keep secret their payments to governments for extra ##cting oil in developing countries .
by doing so , you will join us and count ##less others in what i truly believe is the greatest adventure ever taken , the ever - demand ##ing journey of equality .
so now , if you take this meta ##ph ##or [ of ] genome as program seriously , you have to consider that chris anderson is a computer - fabrica ##ted arti ##fa ##ct , as is jim watson , craig vente ##r , as are all of us .
you ' re going to design something like a cell phone , and in a high - level language , you ' ll describe that cell phone .
so , this is normal dna , what you think of as normal dna .
we heat them up , we add a little bit of salt , we heat them up to almost boi ##ling and cool them down , and as we cool them down , the short strand ##s bind the long strand ##s and start to form structure .
she wrote all her own software to design and built this dna ori ##gami , a beautiful rend ##ition of china , which even has taiwan , and you can see it ' s sort of on the world ' s short ##est lea ##sh , right ?
it was started by erik win ##fre ##e , and what it does , it has til ##es that are a hundred ##th the size of a dna ori ##gami .
and if you do that , the ori ##gami ' s the same size , but the resulting square that you get is three times bigger .
and i think in the next five or 10 years , we ' ll make the kind of square ##s that i described and maybe even get to some of those self - assembled circuits .
when life brought about a series of death and near - death experiences within my close circle , which high ##light ##ed the need for an emergency medical response service in india , similar to 911 in usa .
yet , if you anal ##y ##ze the common man , he or she does not wake up every day and say , " hm ##m , let me see who i can pay a br ##ibe to today . "
it can be worth up to one tri ##llion dollars , being paid in br ##ibe ##s every year , or equal to india ' s gdp .
a set of people actually say , " oh , let me just grant it to them , and run away from it . "
so the data that you ' ve got is a great thing called youtube , and we can go down and basica ##lly pull all the open information from youtube , all the comments , all the views , who ' s watching it , where are they watching it , what are they saying in the comments .
so as we go in here , what we start to see , apply the physics engine again , we see what ' s one conversation is actually composed of many smaller ones .
well here ' s one by jessica green about the micro ##bia ##l ecology of buildings .
masculin ##ity mimi ##cke ##d by men who grew up with no fathers , cam ##ou ##fla ##ge worn by bull ##ies who are dangerous ##ly armed but need hu ##gs .
in ##vest , in ##vest , in ##vest . "
a wise person knows how to imp ##rov ##ise , as luke did when he re - wash ##ed the floor .
all they had was mike ' s hard lemon ##ade , which was five percent alcohol .
we can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis .
don ' t get me wrong . we need rules !
all we ask is , " what serves my interests ? "
be proud that you have them .
so there ' s a lot here at ted , and at other places , to celebrate .
if you do that , the rest is just pretty much a coast down ##hill .
they have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers .
they ' ve been watching too much " terminator . "
it turned out , as i think you could see in aime ##e ' s capabilities and attitudes , people with a desire to do something are quite remarkable and nature is quite ada ##pta ##ble .
i ' ll give you some as ##tou ##nding things that have happened as we started this .
he was lean ##ing on his other arm .
and i get a call and we go back to washington .
i said , " what am i going to say ?
it is an easy answer .
it ' s the path ##finder that shows us a simple road through an imp ##enet ##rable moral maz ##e .
the earth moved for both of them .
there was so many sk ##ept ##ics , especially the press in london , that they started flying cheese ##burger ##s on helicopters around my box to temp ##t me .
so , i went to talk to a doctor friend , and i asked him how could i do that ?
and then there is static ap ##nea .
he ' s six foot four . he ' s 160 pounds .
this was a critical mistake .
and what he did in response , is he went on regis and kelly , and broke his old record .
which was making me more nervous .
it was aw ##ful .
i was like " what ? "
now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper and immediately get the bulletin .
teacher : now move it either side . see what happens .
it ' s just going to do a tiny bit of processing to convert that image that we just took into a sort of digital finger ##print , and the great thing is , if you ' re a professional user , - - so , a newspaper - - the tools are pretty much identical to what we ' ve just used to create this demonstration .
for those of us in this room , it ' s not just the poore ##st and the most vulnerable individual , it ' s the community , it ' s the culture , it ' s the world itself .
last week , bill clinton at the ted awards said , " this situation is un ##pre ##ced ##ented , une ##qua ##l , un ##fair and uns ##table . "
many of you , i think , have probably trek ##ked here .
we ' ve seen the era ##dica ##tion of small ##po ##x .
it is something to be greatly op ##timi ##stic about .
and when they did , they took small ##po ##x to 10 other countries and reign ##ited the epi ##dem ##ic .
there isn ' t a dog on this earth that ' s a natural creature .
well , they ' ve now taken that gene , that biol ##umi ##nes ##cent gene , and put it into mammal cells .
so even as we wo ##rry about it , we have allowed it to go on in this country - - much different in europe - - without any regulation , and even without any identification on the package .
and it raise ##s the question of how we ' re going to define animal species in the age of bio ##technology - - a question that we ' re not really sure yet how to solve .
we ' ve taken away the auto ##nomy of this animal . "
this is a mouse created by charles vacant ##i of the university of massachusetts .
we are directly design ##ing the future of the species of this planet .
and he went on to say , " these differences do not coincide with corresponding differences in climate . "
but uv ##b and uva especially , came in uni ##mpe ##ded .
there was natural selection for the evolution of light ##ly pig ##mente ##d skin .
so we have , in skin pig ##menta ##tion , one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today .
you , you can teach it .
so let me show you a few objects .
to the right , i took a higher rough ##ness .
why so ? because , in fact , the area of the lung is something very ill - defined .
well , they do mix .
i played with it for a while , and i made it return to the origin .
so the idea there was that one must be able to - - how do you say ? - - model price variation .
it ' s so uni ##nter ##esti ##ng .
benoit mand ##el ##bro ##t : frac ##tal ##s and the art of rough ##ness
so , imagine that all of you are participants in the study .
here ' s an example of the puzzle you ' re going to solve .
so , you ' re putting in less juice , and therefore the outcome : fewer puzzle ##s solve ##d .
right ? a patient in the driver ' s seat , for example .
not because there was not enough food - - because there was actually a sur ##plus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country - - but because in the north , people could not access or ent ##it ##le themselves to that food .
did our farmers turn into highly product ##ive commercial actors ?
to give you an example , between 2001 and 2002 , ethiopian maiz ##e farmers produced two years of bu ##mper harvest .
in the american midwest , farmers used to load grain onto bar ##ges and send it up ##river to the chicago market .
that means that the exchange will operate a trading system , which will initially start as an open out ##c ##ry , because we don ' t think the country ' s ready for full electronic trading .
we believe that the stakes are high , but that the returns will be even greater .
it is always the same , never the same , endless ##ly fas ##cina ##ting .
that ' s a potential scenario if we fail to take this seriously .
it provides a physical support structure for the trees , and it creates physical spaces , habita ##ble spaces inside of the sand dune ##s .
then , a few years afterwards , using perm ##ac ##ultura ##l strategies , we green that part of the desert .
it ' s not only something that supports trees , but something that connects people and countries together .
i paid to get it repair ##ed - - then it broke again .
if this idea is truly sound , then the implications are significant .
he ' s bare ##foot . he ' ll run back into his house , and he will conta ##minat ##e his drinking water and his food and his environment with whatever diseases he may be carrying by fe ##cal particles that are on his fingers and feet .
we don ' t have a neutral word for it .
and you might think it ' s just good karma to see these guys sti ##rri ##ng shi ##t , but it ' s also good economic sense , because they ' re saving a million dollars a year .
she grew up in a rural village in a poor area of india , and she was engaged at 14 , and then at 21 or so , she moved into her in - law ' s house .
it ' s the most off - track millennium development goal .
and that was what i did .
there are ten ##s of thousands of those stories out there , and it ' s really hard to con ##jur ##e up much of a sense of well - being , because it just keeps getting worse .
and we tra ##wl , which means to take something the size of a tract ##or trailer truck that wei ##gh ##s thousands and thousands of pounds , put it on a big chain , and drag it across the sea floor to sti ##r up the bottom and catch the fish .
but since we ate all the oy ##sters and we ate all the fish that would eat the plan ##kt ##on , there ' s nothing to eat the plan ##kt ##on and there ' s more and more of it , so it dies of old age , which is un ##hea ##rd of for plan ##kt ##on .
and then , of course , there ' s climate change , and we all know about climate change .
but there are these , what we call , positive feedback ##s , the syne ##rgi ##es among them that make the whole vast ##ly greater than the sum of the parts .
in this bra ##cing talk , coral reef eco ##logist jeremy jackson lay ##s out the shock ##ing state of the ocean today : over ##fish ##ed , over ##hea ##ted , poll ##uted , with indicato ##rs that things will get much worse . aston ##ishing photos and stats make the case .
that ' s - - that ' s not true .
that this old man would inter ##rupt his moonlight str ##oll with his sweet ##heart with the precise reason of making fun of a child .
i went with my friend tim mcg ##oni ##gal , who sat on my left .
the sand ##worm ##s were fine , but your favorite character ?
does something seem strange about this to you ?
she was a single woman about to go alone into a country , not even speaking the language , to travel alone by bus and boat to go to a beach she did not know or had never seen .
she was sm ##iling . she did not understand why i was so wo ##rri ##ed .
but i think we should also just check the numbers , take a reality check here .
joseph sc ##hum ##pet ##er called this " the process of creative destruction . "
is this really how economie ##s be ##hav ##e ? "
what is the objective ?
what does all this mean for economics ?
but it ' s also clear that pro ##sper ##ity goes beyond this .
i mean , can you picture a politician standing up in britain and saying , " gdp fell two percent this year . good news !
i painted it directly on top of the man .
i made the tough decision of going home after graduation and not going up to capitol hill , but going down to my parents ' basement and making it my job to learn how to paint .
when we started out on the milk project , and when i started out , i couldn ' t have fore ##seen that i would go from pur ##su ##ing my dream in politics and working at a desk to trip ##ping over a shadow and then turning people into paintings and painting on people in a pool of milk .
and it goes all the way over to these big , thick , gal ##um ##ph ##y ones that have hundreds of carbon ##s , and they have thousands of hydrogen ##s , and they have vana ##dium and heavy metals and sul ##fur and all kinds of cr ##azi ##ness hanging off the sides of them .
they set the prices , and i don ' t even know .
oka ##y , so the politics of oil are very moral in the united states .
and we take it as , you know - - we look at it on a moral level , rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level .
in fact , it ' s continued to increase .
this is 1988 - - we actually bombe ##d two iranian oil platforms that year .
what you see in this top drawing is a schema ##tic of how petroleum gets used in the u . s . economy .
that ' s a lot .
we are running late .
now you ' d think that " american idol " would introduce a measure of americani ##zation .
and that swim took me 18 minutes and 50 seconds , and it felt like 18 days .
and to the right hand side of us was this great khu ##mb ##u glacier .
we want you to walk up the hill in another two days ' time .
after he sw ##am the north pole , lewis pu ##gh vo ##wed never to take another cold - water dip . then he heard of lake im ##ja in the himalaya ##s , created by recent gl ##acia ##l mel ##ting , and lake pu ##mori , a body of water at an altitude of 530 ##0 m on everest - - and so began a journey that would teach him a radical new way to approach swimming and think about climate change .
this is a state diagram . that ' s an extremely simple computer .
i thought about this in the sense that it ' s great to build in biological materials , but can we do similar things ?
so i was trying to , you know , take the engineer ' s version : can we build a mechanical system in in ##organic materials that will do the same thing ?
and literally with only those two input ##s - - so , the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure - - you can define an infinite number of lens ##es that cover the range of human ref ##rac ##tive error , from minus 12 to plus eight dio ##pter ##s , up to four dio ##pter ##s of cylinder .
but they can show you how to build things in sequence .
you could just hang it as a bed sheet , but again , the comp ##utation of all the physics gives you the aero ##dyn ##ami ##c shape .
and the corre ##lation , of course , is that dense ##r places tend to have lower emissions - - which isn ' t really all that difficult to figure out , if you think about it .
this is a map ##ni ##fice ##nt map that shows me , in this case , how far i can get from my home in 30 minutes using public transportation .
which brings on another th ##res ##hold effect i like to call fur ##nace dum ##ping , which is , quite simply , if you have a building that doesn ' t need to be heat ##ed with a fur ##nace , you save a whole bun ##ch of money up front .
during the twentieth century , we witness ##ed the at ##roci ##ties of stalin , hitler , mao , pol pot , rwanda and other genocide ##s , and even though the twenty - first century is only seven years old , we have already witness ##ed an ongoing genocide in darf ##ur and the daily horror ##s of iraq .
according to non - governmental organizations that keep such statistics , since 1945 , in europe and the americas , there has been a steep decline in interstate wars , in deadly ethnic riot ##s or po ##gro ##ms , and in military coups , even in south america . worldwide , there ' s been a steep decline in deaths in interstate wars . the yellow bars here show the number of deaths per war per year from 1950 to the present .
so that ' s a bit of a support for the levi ##ath ##an theory .
in fact , it ' s as large as western europe , but it only has 300 miles of pave ##d roads .
now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a con ##dom .
and what is the definition then ? " the definition ?
we have liberia . we have congo .
you can watch me for one minute now and you ' ll see the whole thing .
and asia could have social development before they got the economic development .
but more or less , this is what will happen , and we have a world which cannot be looked upon as divided .
and then it ' s united states today , up here .
and we had an increase in income .
the middle income countries , the emerging economy , they are catch ##ing up .
about 20 percent of the adult population are infected .
it ' s caused by fast processing of toxic cass ##ava root in famine situation .
and we have a high hope in you . thank you very much .
next best thing to a video game .
you have them in hunter - gat ##here ##r societies , but then through technological evolution , new forms of technology aris ##e that facilitate or encourage the playing of non - zero - sum games , involving more people over larger territory .
and i would say the non - zero - sum dynamic is only going to grow more intense over time because of technological trends , but more intense in a kind of negative way .
it ' s when people ' s fortune ##s are corre ##lated .
i think it ' s the first step toward that . that ' s the long - term goal .
the g ##8 summit proposes that the solution to africa ' s problems should be a massive increase in aid , something aki ##n to the marshall plan .
but equally , it has opportunities and a lot of potential .
well , since i ' m not seeing the hand , it appears that what i ' m stating is true .
well , because it gives them good , paying jobs , or , in many african countries , unofficial opportunities to profit from corruption .
governments are not changing it . why ?
there were 56 , and when our president wanted to amen ##d the constitution and remove term limits , he had to create 25 new districts , and now there are 81 .
doctor sel ##ig ##man , what is the state of psychology today ? "
and the conclusion of that is that psychology and psychiatry , over the last 60 years , can actually claim that we can make mise ##rable people less mise ##rable .
i ' ve spent my life working on extremely mise ##rable people , and i ' ve asked the question , how do extremely mise ##rable people differ from the rest of you ?
so i want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them .
when he walks onto the floor of the american exchange at 9 : 30 in the morning , time stops for him . and it stops till the closing bell .
and meaning , in this view , consists of - - very parallel to eu ##dai ##monia - - it consists of knowing what your highest strength ##s are , and using them to belong to and in the service of something larger than you are .
so , the next to last thing i want to say is we ' re interested in how much life satisfaction people have .
but they were empty .
these are camel ##s moving across the rift valley in africa , photograph ##ed by chris johns .
now i have to tell you , i was talking to kyle last week about this , that i was going to tell this story .
a lion having a late night sna ##ck - - notice he ' s got a broken tooth .
for the first time in history , more people live in urban , rather than rural , environments .
brian photograph ##ed a marine sanctuary in new zealand , where commercial fishing had been banned - - the result being that the over ##fish ##ed species have been restored , and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries .
but then paul got in the water .
david griffin : how photography connects us
so , if we use information that comes off of this spec ##ular reflection , we can go from a traditional face sc ##an that might have the gross contour ##s of the face and the basic shape , and aug ##ment it with information that puts in all of that skin por ##e structure and fine wr ##ink ##les .
we can turn the volume up a little bit if that ' s available .
what i ' ve been doing from 14 to 17 was , i was assist ##ing them collecting ivory tus ##k , meat and whatever they were killing , po ##ach ##ing , hunting in the forest , bring it in the main city to get access to the market .
here we have savanna gira ##ffe ##s , but through evolution we have this forest gira ##ffe that lives only in congo .
you can ' t ask him how old he is because he has guns .
and that was the language of the war .
and they can ' t do what they are doing .
and one day , we went for a meeting .
i oppose it - - that they are now going to disse ##ct it , until i do my report and then i see the chief commander .
see what the wars in rwanda .
building capa ##citi ##es for the young generation is going to make a better generation and a better future tomorrow for africa .
did you know that , in iraq and afghanistan , there were more private military contract ##ors on the ground than there were u . s . military troops ?
let ' s see what people here think about it .
oh , after you stopped paying .
for fear of disa ##gre ##ement , we shri ##nk from these questions .
some of the reasons for this are not really very controversial .
the vertical axis now is thousands of dollars in today ' s prices .
all the rest went to the top one percent .
that comes out at five to 10 tons daily per square mile in cities .
you have to choose either option a or option b .
and some people would say that we ' re born with it in some other means .
everything except random ##ness . she did not believe in random ##ness .
and that ' s what i look for in my work , a personal meaning .
but , both of these saying ##s - - saving a fish from dro ##wn ##ing , or saving a man from dro ##wn ##ing - - to me they had to do with intentions .
it may be something that is perhaps more serious - - as i said , human rights in burma .
well , what is random ? what is chance ? what is luck ?
i was able to see that in a first ##hand way , when i went to beautiful dong village , in gui ##zhou , the poore ##st province of china .
i believe in specific ##s , the specific ##s of story , and the past , the specific ##s of that past , and what is happen ##ing in the story at that point .
and the reason is that until wonder came along and figure ##d out how to spread the idea of sl ##ice ##d bread , no one wanted it .
right . i go to the deli ; i ' m sick ; i need to buy some medicine .
who ' s going to stop and pull over and say - - oh , look , a cow . nobody .
they turned a chair from something the pur ##chas ##ing department bought , to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work .
talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends .
ami ##hot ##orn ##ot . com - - everyday 250 , 000 people go to this site , run by two volunteers , and i can tell you they are hard grade ##rs , and they didn ' t get this way by advertising a lot .
silk . put a product that does not need to be in the ref ##rige ##rated section next to the milk in the ref ##rige ##rated section .
in a world of too many options and too little time , our obvious choice is to just ign ##ore the ordinary stuff . marketing guru seth god ##in spell ##s out why , when it comes to getting our attention , bad or bizarre ideas are more successful than bor ##ing ones .
now , speaking of walls , i want to share with you the story of one wall in cairo .
most of the economic models are built around scar ##city and growth .
if we can make it through the next 150 years , i think that your great great grand ##child ##ren will forget all about malt ##hus .
the problem is that these pu ##ps need a stable platform of solid ice in order to nurse from their mom ##s .
we can ' t keep taking without ex ##pect ##ing serious consequences as a result .
i didn ' t want them to be over ##ly threat ##ening or scar ##y .
here we see a female cr ##aw ##ling out of the ocean under moonlight on the island of trinidad .
72 percent of the population has such scar ##s , but most don ' t shed the gear , things like lo ##bst ##er trap ##s and cr ##ab pot ##s .
i worked in other parts of new zealand as well , in beautiful , fragile , protected areas like in fi ##ord ##land , where this sea pen colony was found .
it ' s hor ##rib ##le . it ' s a proof of our failing to save them in the wild .
when i stood there in the grass , it ' s hot - - not even the sound of insects - - just this wa ##ving grass .
now in this reci ##pe you also have the cost .
and once the soil gets drie ##d , you ' re in a dry season - - you get crack ##s , oxygen goes in , flames come out and the problem starts all over again .
but , it ' s more complicated . it ' s not that simple , and you have to work with the people .
and this is after two years .
and look , there ' s now 11 . 2 percent more clouds - - already , after three years .
but whatever you do in that program , it has to be fully supported by the people , meaning that you also have to ad ##jus ##t it to the local , cultural values .
all the sculptures move by mechanical means .
it sounds good , but i ' ll bet you know in your gut that it ' s not the whole truth , and i ' ll tell you why .
and i wait ##ed , and the next day i like ##d it a bit better , the next day i like ##d it a bit better , and now i really love it .
freeway ##s .
what i ' m trying to say is the major contribution on carbon emissions are from the cars - - more than 50 percent - - so when we depend only on cars , it ' s . . .
you should have always a structure of living and working together .
and we cannot have all the answers .
oka ##y , now why then is this cur ##ious re ##lu ##cta ##nce and cur ##ious host ##ility to consciousness ?
how could spiritual ##ity move anything ?
and just as the jar full of water can go from liquid to solid depending on the behavior of the molecules , so your brain can go from a state of being con ##scio ##us to a state of being un ##cons ##cious , depending on the behavior of the molecules .
oka ##y , the next feature of consciousness , after this marvel ##ous unified con ##scio ##us field , is that it functions causa ##lly in our behavior .
it ' s only relative to con ##scio ##us agents that a piece of paper is money or that a bun ##ch of buildings is a university .
i won ' t demonstrate pain behavior , but i can tell you i ' m not having any pain ##s right now .
but i believe there ' s a second climate crisis , which is as severe , which has the same origins , and that we have to deal with with the same ur ##gen ##cy .

today ' s professional theater community is defined , not only the shaw and stratford festivals , but by the corners ##tone theater of los angeles - - a collective of artists that after 9 / 11 , brought together 10 different religious communities - - the bahia , the catholic , the muslim , the jewish , even the native american and the gay and lesbian communities of faith , helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play , where they explore ##d the differences in their faith and found common ##ali ##ty as an important first step toward cross - community healing .
we want to play you one more selection .
and that ' s how i got out of high school .
at a reception in their court ##yard , i notice ##d that they had a fountain because they think that the people who go to the museum dese ##rve a fountain .
and so the next thing you ' ll see is a million dollar kitchen that was built by the heinz company - - you ' ve heard of them ?
we have students who sit together , black kids and white kids , and what we ' ve discovered is you can solve the race problem by creating a world class environment , because people will have a tende ##ncy to show you world class behavior if you treat them in that way .
that ' s our library with more hand ##craft ##ed furniture .
he was drag ##ging guys out of bars and saving those lives for the lord .
she said , " well , i work for a company called he ##wl ##ett - packard . "
and i want my music to be with you . "
and that ' s the building , and that ' s the model , and on the right ' s a high - tech green ##house and in the middle ' s the medical technology building .
this is in a place called san francisco .
i said , " well , that ' s very nice .
because mr . ross used to bring in your albums when i was 16 years old in the pottery class , when the world was all dark , and your music got me to the sun ##light . "
it ' s really our first fora ##y into this .
so it consists of two parts , what we call an en ##code ##r and a trans ##duc ##er .
so let me show you , and i ' m going to start with the standard method first .
this man is supposed to represent a generic human being , and all of the circles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body .
we ' re not doing anything to the cells here .
this is like the steal ##th bomber of the ocean .
this is the vi ##brio fischer ##i molecule .
they take that information inside , and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who ' s in the minority and who ' s in the majority of any given population .
we ' ve also done the same thing with the pink system .
this is exactly what happens in your body .
look at all the arguments we have these days over health care , over bonus ##es and bai ##lou ##ts on wall street , over the gap between rich and poor , over af ##firma ##tive action and same - sex marriage .
actually , that was aris ##tot ##le ' s answer too .
he was a very good golfe ##r , but he had a disability .
what ' s your name ?
is walking the course essential to the game ?
first , no real sports fan would talk that way .
so let ' s step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might improve , elev ##ate , the terms of political discourse in the united states , and for that matter , around the world .
michael sande ##l : the lost art of democratic debate
you know , a lot of people said , " well , you know , city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time .
and , i say that that ' s fine - - the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice .
we ' ve discovered things like , for example , rna interference only a few years ago , and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work .
the therapie ##s will be improving faster than the remaining imp ##er ##fect ##ions in the therapie ##s are catch ##ing up with us .
second ##ly , what does it mean for the public ' s perception of how long it ' s going to take for us to get to those things , starting from the time we get the mice ?
we can call it the " engineering approach , " and i claim that the engineering approach is within range .
some of them are partially implemented already , the ones at the top .
audience : species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to proc ##rea ##te .
there are species that have no ag ##ing - - hydra for example - - but they do it by not having a nervous system - - and not having any tissue ##s in fact that re ##ly for their function on very long - lived cells .
and although i want to thank the talent ##ed people of our company fore ##most for that - - and also there ' s a factor of luck and timing - - we are absolute ##ly convinced that we did this because of our values .
i have days that i believe , but i have days that i ' m full of doubt .
so we should em ##bra ##ce our difference and aim for challenge .
what happens when a city decides it ' s going to set other prior ##ities ?
according to the center for disease control , fully one third of all children born after 2000 will get diabetes .
and we take car crash ##es for granted .
but , of course , we ' ve seen what that does .
you don ' t want to tell americans , god for ##bid , that they have to change their lifestyle .
the second reason is that we killed these things .
well , we looked at the tissue under the micro ##scope .
the first one that we see occurs in the ancient rain ##for ##est ##s of australia about 25 million years ago , and the national geographic society is helping us to explore these fossil deposits . this is rivers ##leigh .
wild dogs did eat a few of the sheep , but the thy ##laci ##ne got a bad rap .
they ' re related distant ##ly to thy ##laci ##nes .
he thought hard . i mean , it was nearly 80 years before this that he ' d been at this hut .
it ' s very , very difficult to speak at the end of a conference like this , because everyone has spoken . everything has been said .
now , why is all this important , to have to go really fast ?
creating our own program to solve problems , like fighting corruption , building institutions , stabili ##zing the micro economy .
is it being directed effectively ?
it was really hot . i was very hung ##ry .
and now let me become less sentimental , and say that saving lives - - which some of the aid we get does on this continent - - when you save the life of anyone , a farmer , a teacher , a mother , they are contributing product ##ivel ##y into the economy .
when we ask them and tell them what we need , one of my wo ##rri ##es today is that we have many foundations now .
our ina ##bility to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money , " sit down . "
aid cannot solve our problems , i ' m firm ##ly convinced about that .
a lot has been said here about women , i don ' t need to repeat it .
i ' m going to go over some science experiments and try to cover three musical experiments .
and so all of us have this remarkable brain , which is poorly understood to say the least .
you can ' t just sort of - - " it ' s great we ' ve got this keyboard . "
really , consciousness is seat ##ed in the frontal lo ##be .
cl : at this point , i ' ll take a few moments .
so what we had them do was mem ##ori ##ze this lower - left sound icon , please .
so just to conclude , we ' ve got a lot of questions to ask , and like i said , we ' ll ask questions here , not answer them .
look , the world has changed from analog to digital .
a tech ##nici ##an will put the electro ##des onto the sc ##al ##p using a conduct ##ive gel or past ##e and usually after a procedure of preparing the sc ##al ##p by light ab ##rasi ##on .
the first time , nothing will happen , because the system has no idea how he think ##s about " pull . "
and once you ' ve trained up the detection ##s , these thoughts can be assigned or map ##ped to any computing platform , application or device .
so i ' m going to briefly discuss a couple of problems that we have and a couple of problems where we ' ve got some solutions under ##way .
esther du ##fl ##o talk ##ed a little bit about this .
the other thing is , you know , it would be even better if you didn ' t have to draw the blood .
there ' s all these different intervention ##s but they have different kinds of effectiveness .
in 1935 , there were 150 , 000 cases a year of malaria in the united states , but dd ##t and a massive public health effort managed to sq ##uel ##ch it .
now , it turns out we only kill the female mosquito ##es .
here we have it running at high - speed mode .
it ' s then sold and bought , and it ' s then delivered to me .
but i thought , no , no , experiment with res ##ins , experiment with pol ##ymer ##s .
three comp ##ost bin ##s - - go through about 70 kilo ##s of raw veget ##able waste a week - - really good , makes fantastic comp ##ost .
very advanced , no air - condition ##ing - - i love it .
that ' s zero food waste .
basica ##lly i ' m recording one second of every day of my life for the rest of my life , chr ##ono ##logical ##ly comp ##iling these one - second tiny sl ##ices of my life into one single continuous video until , you know , i can ' t record them any ##more .
it helped me reali ##ze something else during this project , is that recording that one second on a really bad day is extremely difficult .
and we can start a film about that , and we can see a little bit back ##wards in time .
these are the distances of the tubes which make it walk that way .
it ' s a binary step counter .
you can only do them one at a time .
i think philosophical ##ly , that was one of the most important papers that we ' ve ever done because it showed how dynamic life was .
so the team developed new deb ##ug ##ging software , where we could test each synthetic fragment to see if it would grow in a background of wild type dna .
and we added three quota ##tions , because with the first genome we were criticized for not trying to say something more prof ##oun ##d than just signing the work .
or , more important ##ly , hiv , where the virus evo ##lve ##s so quickly the va ##cci ##nes that are made today can ' t keep up with those evolutionary changes .
so i read slowly .
this was perhaps the biggest surprise - - how flexible the koran is , at least in minds that are not fundamental ##ly inf ##lex ##ible .
i study ants , and that ' s because i like to think about how organizations work .
and they do that by each year sending out the rep ##rod ##uctive ##s - - those are the ones with wings - - on a matin ##g flight .
and it stay ##s that size until the queen dies and there ' s nobody to make more ants , when she ' s about 15 or 20 years old .
on one day , it ' ll all be here , and then the next day they ' ll move it over there , and then they ' ll move it back .
they some ##how get into this reserve .
well it turns out that yes , the different tasks are inter ##de ##pende ##nt .
so , the ants in the older colony that seem to be more stable are not any older than the ants in the younger colony .
they ' ve gone out to do different tasks , and the rate at which they meet as they come in and out of the nest entrance determine ##s , or influences , each ant ' s decision about whether to go out , and which task to perform .
but in a small colony , it ' s likely to meet fewer fora ##gers , just because there are fewer other fora ##gers there to meet .
but it ' s the greatest transfer of wealth , from one group to another in the history of man ##kind .
yes , it ' s going to continue .
it ' s 130 oct ##ane fuel .
i don ' t have to wo ##rry about the bridge to where at my age .
in a nuts ##hel ##l that ' s what happened ?
and so everyone can be at least happy to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas .
and number two , do not build a reformer on the ocean .
i don ' t understand why the media is focused on eastern pennsylvania .
boone , i really , really app ##rec ##iate you coming here , eng ##aging in this conversation .
" the el ##dora ##do of the united states of america : the discovery of ine ##x ##haus ##tib ##le gold mines in california . "
half of them desert ##ed to go look for gold .
but they spent three and a half million dollars in the 2000 super bowl to air that ad , even though , at the time , they only had a million dollars in annual revenue .
this is work going on down in lower manhattan where they built some of the first electric power generating stations .
this came in , like , six different colors .
i mean , you didn ' t want this thing cl ##og ##ging up a light soc ##ket .
and one friend of mine was telling me a story : not only did they get there and have to wait , but then the engineers , when they finally did get there , for the third time , they had to call somebody .
i ' m going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history of comp ##ass ##ion and the golden rule .
now , there ' s more good news that came along later in evolution , a second kind of evolutionary logic .
now , we have a rational ##e for that .
and if you ask what kind of situation is con ##duc ##ive to people defini ##ng people as enemies , it ' s a zero - sum situation .
it ' s why social organization has grown from the hunter - gat ##here ##r village to the ancient state , the empire , and now here we are in a global ##ized world .
i think politicians can help foster non - zero - sum relationships , economic engagement is generally better than block ##ades and so on , in this regard .
it ' s un ##fort ##una ##te that they tend to be selective ##ly deployed .
what time of life had they started school ?
he actively sought disco ##n ##firmation .
in surveys of european and american executive ##s , fully 85 percent of them acknowledged that they had issues or concerns at work that they were afraid to raise .
but he had been so afraid of conflict , until finally he became more afraid of the silence .
so , what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer , sources of cancer , or , for that matter , why you are who you are , didn ' t make sense .
so , i decided over the years , because of a series of experiments that this is because of context and architecture .
and we said , wonderful ! look at this pretty structure .
i made a radical hypothesis .
we have shown that there ' s little pieces of dna on the specific genes of the mamma ##ry gl ##and that actually respond to extra ##cel ##lular matrix .
but here is a poem from ye ##ats . i ' ll just read you the last two lines .
it ' s been fantastic .
it sounds a little bit like a weird book , but actually they ' re all new types of lies .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about himself . surprise , surprise .
my friends , no way they can be that cool and have good of a life .
well , to do that , one thing is we can look at the dec ##eption - detection literature .
any ##body do any writing today ? did any ##body write a word ?
those cold , hard winters , i love it .
now , when you are about to say or do something , we can think , do i want this to be part of my legacy , part of my personal record ?
though in all serious ##ness , this position that you just saw me in , looking down at my phone , that ' s one of the reasons behind this project , project glass .
we had to keep it secret from our industrial designer until she actually accepted the job , and then she almost ran away scream ##ing .
but i do that all the time .
i go back to color all the time .
my mother was , sort of , very sensitive to his mother , who it seemed was a little bit sk ##ept ##ical about the whole alternative lifestyle thing .
i went to performing arts high school , where i was an actor .
and so i had this t . v . show .
and there ' s got to be some way to do that , rosie .
and i often look at things as though they ' re food .
chef : oh , you don ' t know ? let me tell you something .
fashion designer isaac miz ##rah ##i spin ##s through a diz ##zy ##ing array of inspiration ##s - - from ' 50 ##s pin ##up ##s to a fleet ##ing gli ##mps ##e of a woman on the street who makes him sho ##ut " stop the cab ! " inside this ram ##bling talk are real cl ##ues to living a happy , creative life .
and i was actually a pote ##nt force in spread ##ing ideas across borders , and i witness ##ed the rise of islam ##ist extrem ##ism as distinct from islam the faith , and the way in which it influenced my co - religion ##ists across the world .
what ' s actually happen ##ing is that what were previously locali ##zed par ##ochia ##lis ##ms , individual or group ##ings of extrem ##ists who were isolated from one another , have become inter ##con ##nec ##ted in a global ##ized way and have thus become , or are becoming , mainstream .
and a social movement is comprise ##d , in my view , it ' s comprise ##d of four main characteristics .
the second , i believe , is political correct ##ness .
not exclusive to these things , but in addition to them , is prop ##aga ##ting a gen ##uine demand for democracy on the ground .
because it ' s not enough to remove a leader or ruler or di ##cta ##tor .
it isn ' t when the shin ##y new tools show up that their uses start perm ##eat ##ing society .
the internet is the first medium in history that has native support for groups and conversation at the same time .
the bbc got their first wind of the chinese qua ##ke from twitter .
and finally the chinese crack ##ed down .
all of that is over .
he had to issue a rep ##ly .
ok , this is mount everest .
it was a national geographic expedition , but it was organized by the explorer ##s club .
there ' s no ice over it .
from here , it ' s about 1 , 500 feet up at a 30 - degree angle to the summit .
this is a view taken along the summit ridge .
it ' s really cold ; it ' s 24 , 000 feet .
the survivors came in one by one .
after lay ##ing in the snow that long a time , he got up and found his way back to the camp .
he ' s dying .
he was critically ill , there were other critically ill patients ; luck ##ily , we were able to get a helicopter in to rescue these guys .
so ideas change states .
but a demographic divide ##nd is only as good as the investment in your human capital .
and then i think the other point is that indians today are far more comfort ##able with global ##ization .
it ' s certainly not like china .
what are those ideas ? one is , i think , are ide ##ological issues .
we can use technology for trans ##pare ##ncy , and many other things .
if we really want to come to a point , we really want to put a cap on our carbon emission , we want to really lower the use of energy - - it has to be solve ##d in countries like india .
and this is a rainy election day in a small country - - that can be my country , but could be also your country .
so basica ##lly i want to ask : what went right and what went wrong in these 50 years when we talk about democracy ?
and you have the market revolution of the 1980s and the huge increase of ine ##qua ##lity in societies .
you have facebook revolution ##s , twitter revolution ##s .
in a small country that could be my country , but could be also your country , they took a decision - - it is a real case story - - that all of the governmental decisions , discussions of the council of ministers , were going to be published on the internet 24 hours after the council discussions took place .
the idea is called the social impact bond .
the service providers , well , for the first time , they ' ve got an opportunity to provide services and grow the evidence for what they ' re doing in a really construct ##ive way and learn and demonstrate the value of what they ' re doing over five or six years , not just one or two as often happens at the moment .
it enable ##s testing of new ideas in a way that ' s less difficult for everybody .
" ha , i ' m the only person i ever loved . "
he goes , " sir , why don ' t you drive ? "
why is that ? are you too tire ##d to go all the way around ?
i ' m not supposed to be , like , walking down the ais ##le , and be like , " hi , jack . " you know , that ' s not cool .
was ##su ##p .
ted ##x .
decided to use rec ##yc ##led content from cement and steel manufacturing .
we must change everything .
it is transparent , made just for you .
they were missing the vision .
so once those pictures are acquired and the physician has drawn all the necessary safety limits and so on , he select ##s basica ##lly a point - - you see the round point in the middle where the curso ##r is - - and he presses this blue button called " sonic ##ate . "
john is one of [ about ] a dozen very heroi ##c , courage ##ous people who volunteer ##ed for the study .
he ' s a 78 year - old farmer who suffered from - - how should i say it ? - - it ' s called pain in the but ##t .
i don ' t see , without this nation taking it as some collective will or something that is a national goal to make that happen , it will not happen .
so new life was born .
all they have , really , is trademark protection , and so it means that any ##body could copy any gar ##ment on any person in this room and sell it as their own design .
now , fashion designers have the broad ##est pale ##tte ima ##gina ##ble in this creative industry .
one that a lot of cultural critics have pointed to is that we now have a much broad ##er pale ##tte of design choice ##s to choose from than we ever have before , and this is mainly because of the fast fashion industry , actually .
i love these gallia ##nos .
if you look at the registry , actually , a lot of the registered things in the e . u .
fire ##works displays , the sm ##ell of per ##fum ##e : no .
it is bare ##ly tet ##here ##d to any sort of physical reality in our minds .
i ' d been traveling in japan without an agenda other than to photograph , and then i heard about this tree that is 2 , 180 years old and knew that i had to go visit it .
and then this back down on the ground and you can see that the fung ##us is actually in ##vad ##ing this tree .
but i put that slide in there because i ' m often asked if there are any animals in the project .
and what looks like two big he ##aps of leaves , is actually two single leaves that get sh ##red ##ded up by the har ##sh desert conditions over time .
this bacteria was discovered several years ago by a team of planetary biologi ##sts hop ##ing to find cl ##ues to life on other planets by looking at one of the har ##she ##st conditions on ours .
it will be completely free , and it will work in any browser .
i think pop ##cor ##n could change the way that we tell stories on the web , and the way we understand the world we live in .
consider the 2008 terrorist attack on mumbai .
is he bald in front ? does he wear glass ##es ? "
you could rob 200 people on a train , a great innovation .
you see , if you can print in metal , you can print one of these , and in fact you can also print one of these too .
and to hacker ##s , dna is just another operating system waiting to be hack ##ed .
that ' s what i get asked all the time .
the threat is serious , and the time to prepare for it is now .
will i be marginal ##ized ?
and when we think about legacy , i can think of no more powerful one , despite how short her life was .
and there is no group more vulnerable to those kinds of mani ##pulation ##s than young men .
i know it works .

and we placed him in a company in western kenya , just 200 miles away .
so , what do you think ?
and last ##ly , the only portrait of a male that leonardo painted , " the musician . "
ladies and gentlemen , this story has not yet been published .

and i remember looking into the ice , and there were big chun ##ks of white ice in there , and the water was completely black .
lp : i ' d just like to end off by just saying this : it took me four months again to feel my hands .
the talk will be broad ##ly about energy , but oil ' s a good place to start .
and so , 25 years ago , there was a peak oil ; just like , in the 1920s , there was a peak coal ; and a hundred years before that , there was a peak wood .
it ' s not different , it ' s the same stuff : calcium carbon ##ate , calcium carbon ##ate .
it ' s not because we ' re going to build a ba ##jil ##lion wind ##mill ##s .
that ' s the one advantage that older people have .
and i said , " i have no training as a doctor . i never claimed that . "
and then she made me go up with the tape of it and prove that george abbott actually could talk .
and , incident ##ally , i call her the eleanor roosevelt of the right .
and i said , " i ' m learning . "

one is the large global economy , the large global ##ized economy , and the other one is the small , and very limited , capacity of our traditional governments and their international institutions to govern , to shape , this economy .

but it is difficult to hear the words al ##oud .
there was hollywood .
so when i read in a newspaper in the business page the story of no ##lly ##wood , i really felt this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story that goes against all these pre ##con ##cei ##ved notion ##s .
we ' re not doing films for the elite and the people in their glass houses .
it ' s all about the foreign movies .
move it .
the nigerian filmmaker ##s really , really , are doing what they like .

it ' s about rolling a ball and pick ##ing up as many objects as you can in a finite amount of time and hope ##fully you ' ll be able to make it into a planet .
so we have portal because you shoot walls in order to create new spaces .
so time , space , aes ##thetic ##s , and then , most important , behavior .

so , some societies , for sub ##tle environmental reasons , are more fragile than others . and then finally , another generali ##zation . i ' m now teaching a course at ucla , to ucla undergraduate ##s , on these collapse ##s of societies . what really bugs my ucla undergraduate students is , how on earth did these societies not see what they were doing ?
instead , all the major threats facing us today are problems entirely of our own making . and since we made the problems , we can also solve the problems . that then means that it ' s entirely in our power to deal with these problems .

what are you eating ?

this has happened in the netherlands in the 1990s during the classical sw ##ine fever outbreak .

these things that i photograph ##ed - - this tire pile here had 45 million tire ##s in it . it was the largest one .

this is wu ##shan , one of the largest cities that was relocated .

the more sur ##pris ##ing thing was that when we collaborated with economist ##s to actually look at the monkey ##s ' data using economic tools , they basica ##lly match ##ed , not just qualitat ##ivel ##y , but quantitat ##ivel ##y with what we saw humans doing in a real market .
your other option is a bit safe . your just going to get some money for sure .

now if i go on like this , you ' ll think that all the data comes from huge institutions and has nothing to do with you .
you may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there but you know to demand it .
all together , they achieved these results : increased the number of people on anti - retro ##vira ##ls , life - saving anti - aids drugs ; nearly halve ##d deaths from malaria ; va ##cci ##nated so many that 5 . 4 million lives will be saved .
now here , we see the role for an un ##pre ##ced ##ented coalition of social media giants and ups ##tart ##s , telecom ##s companies , reality tv show formats , gaming companies , telecom ##s , all of them together in kind of their " we are the world " moment .
it ' s getting near zero .
thank you , thank you .
and he said , " oh , i teach at a college of arts .
so i just thought , " i ' m going to capture thumb ##print , foot ##print , or whatever traces we leave as humans . "
if we ask einstein , he would say , " whether the cow crossed the road , or the road moved under ##nea ##th the cow , depends on your frame of reference . "
again , " in ##ward out . "
and this was collected by ana ##pu ##m - - which is like , finally in the end , he will not have anything , because it will eva ##pora ##te .
this gave me a greater faith .
you can see the detail .
i ' m a little bit of an amateur historian , so i ' ve spent some time going back , trying to see the first mention of this kind of thing . and the best , earliest quote that i could find was one from david livingstone , writing in the 1850 ##s about how the railroad , the steam ship , and the telegraph were integra ##ting east africa perfect ##ly with the rest of the world .
so it ' s very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that i talk about in my book , " world 3 . 0 , " that we ' re very , very far from the no - border effect bench ##mark , which would imp ##ly international ##ization levels of the order of 85 , 90 , 95 percent .
the perspective was , here is this poor professor .
think of france and the current debate about immigration .
at the same time , i was thinking , well , there ' s lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products , away from the ethnic , a little bit more contemporary .
but if we rear ##range this formula quickly , we can get to acceleration equal ##s force over mass , which means that for a larger particle - - a larger mass - - it requires more force to change its direction .
the marketing is - - the message for marketing is - - that try to measure what consumers actually do , rather than what they say they ' ll do or antic ##ip ##ate they ' ll do .
your brand starts being dis ##pers ##ed , it gets more chao ##tic .
and the third string is pretty innovative .
so , for example , you can be a pitcher or a catch ##er , and that correspond ##s to whether you perform a sexual act or receive a sexual act .
can you imagine saying to your coach , " uh , i ' m not really feeling it today , i think i ' ll sit this game out . "
" well , maybe we can go half and half . "
and sometimes that can be different amounts over different times or with different people or on different days .
" what ' ti ##s to love ? " shakespeare said .

in short , they are ac ##qui ##ring the status that they had a million years ago , 10 , 000 years ago , 100 , 000 years ago .
it ' s one of many , many characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market .
we ' re also returning to an ancient form of marriage equality .
this is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you ' ve made love to them .

and everybody there agreed this woman was very sick and she needed to be in the hospital .
i actually just ass ##med the path ##ologi ##c sequence of events was settled science .
in fact , what if it ' s a sy ##mp ##tom of a much deeper problem , the tip of a prove ##rb ##ial ice ##berg ?
now i don ' t know why , but it might be because , in their case , their cells haven ' t actually figure ##d out the right thing to do with that excess energy .
but this team of multi - disciplina ##ry , highly sk ##ept ##ical and ex ##cee ##ding ##ly talent ##ed researchers do agree on two things .
peter atti ##a : is the obe ##sity crisis hiding a bigger problem ?
so when i was born , i gu ##ess you could say expectations were kind of high for me .
i mean , i think most people in the industry understand that we ' ve got to get on with it .
frank ##ly , four billion clean cars on the road are still four billion cars , and a traffic jam with no emissions is still a traffic jam .
now shared car services are also spring ##ing up around the world , and these efforts , i think , are great .
we need that same kind of passion and energy to attack global grid ##lock .
charlie led ##bett ##er , yesterday , i thought , talk ##ed very arti ##cula ##tely about this need to bring consumers , to bring people into the process of creating things .
so they sna ##ppe ##d into action .
george de mest ##ral - - this is not bugs all over a bir ##kens ##toc ##k - - was walking his dog in a field and got covered in burr ##s , sort of little pri ##ck ##ly things , and from that came vel ##cro .
it ' s been all about these kind of thought ##less things that people do , which have huge intention and huge opportunity .
i talk about un ##thi ##nki ##ng situations all the time .
so , again , we were asked to design a water pump for a company called app ##rote ##c , in kenya .
conta ##gio ##us is a good word .
and in two hours , after their back ##s were broke , they were changed .
they are skating . they are doing street plays .
k first time , a rally and a street play in a rural school - - un ##hea ##rd of - - to tell their parents why literacy is important .
so , today who is it going to take to spread the infection from 100 , 000 children to the 200 million children in india ?
and interesting ##ly , as i think back , they were the first true environmental ##ists .
unfortunately , it ' s not the answer .
if i pull back from that global picture , and i look at the implica ##tion over a similar period of time in terms of the technology - - which , as a tool , is a tool for designers , and i cite our own experience as a company , and i just ill ##ust ##rate that by a small selection of projects - - then how do you measure that change of technology ?
round about that design period leading up to this building , i did a sketch , which we pulled out of the archive recently .
so for example , we would put models under an artificial sky .
so really , ret ##rans ##lati ##ng that technology and developing something which was so clean , it was virtually pollution - free .
so there has been a project which rescue ##s the dead sea by creating a pipeline , a pipe , sometimes above the surface , sometimes buried , that will red ##ress that , and will feed from the gulf of aq ##aba into the dead sea .
it ' s more than one device , you know , it ' s rene ##wa ##ble .
and here you can see how they really craft ##ed a beautiful design process with physical models , with quantitat ##ive , as well as qualitat ##ive , methods to come to a final solution that is truly integrated and completely hol ##istic with the architecture .
to me it is something from theatre , and i will get back to that a little bit later .
so light is , of course , for social interaction also - - to create relationships with all the features around us .
and we can actually leave it out where it ' s not needed at all and where we can preserve darkness .
can we be more gent ##le with light ?
in architecture , it works just the same .
is it that i write very well ?

if this woman has to carry water on her head for miles and miles and miles , you cannot be celebra ##ting that .
they could be creative in terms of education , they may be creative in terms of culture , they may be creative in terms of institutions ; but a lot of our work is in the field of technological creat ##ivity , the innovations , either in terms of contemporary innovations , or in terms of traditional knowledge .

so , having seen this , and having wo ##rri ##ed about it for eight years , the first thing i do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys , call aa ##rp , get an appointment right away .
we ' ve been working on this , actually , as an alternative energy source , starting way back with johnson & amp ; johnson , to run an ib ##ot , because the best batteries you could get - - 10 watt - hours per kilo ##gram in lead , 20 watt - hours per kilo ##gram nickel - cad ##mium , 40 watt - hours per kilo ##gram in nickel - metal hyd ##ride , 60 watt - hours per kilo ##gram in lit ##hium , 8 , 750 watt - hours of energy in every kilo ##gram of prop ##ane or gas ##olin ##e - - which is why nobody drives electric cars .

however , while it ' s easier to think of us , the citizens , the police , the army , as the good guys , and them , the nar ##cos , the cartel ##es , as the bad guys , if you think about it , the latter are only providing a service to the former .
but this is the result of a very care ##ful brand ##ing and business strategy .
they have actually retained access to the profit ##able drug trade , but the way they do it is , because they control all of michoacan , and they control the port of lazaro cardenas , they lever ##age that to , for example , trade copper from michoacan that is legally created and legally extra ##cted with illegal ep ##hed ##rine from china which is a critical precursor for met ##ham ##phe ##tami ##nes that they produce , and then they have partnership ##s with larger organizations like the sinaloa federation that place their products in the u . s .
and so to me the question is not whether these dynamics will continue the way they have .
and then it ' s time to do it again . last year .
the next phase it hit was dis ##placement .
here ' s another technology that ' s approach ##ing a critical price .
you can have regen ##erat ##ive brak ##ing ; you can have drive - by - wire ; you can have replace ##able body shape ##s - - it ' s a little thing that starts with a hybrid , but it can lead to a whole new era of the car .
and what ' s interesting is that it was just 1990 when it was more than two dollars a minute .
they use mob ##utu as meta ##ph ##or .
i want to share one story about an innovation called dr ##ip irrigation .
and so we met dr . sono khang ##hara ##ni in pakistan .
but again i would say that this is our moment for extraordinary things to happen .
and for the first time ever in three generations , his children would go to school .
thank you .
you have my friend , who has a blog on digital - - on pd ##rs , personal recorde ##rs .
i like music , and i like banjo ##s , and i think i probably heard steve martin playing , and i said , " i could do that . "
i wrote this one , and i put this up because of einstein today .
and you see this post .
i showed a norman rock ##well painting before , and this one i grew up with , looking at constantly .
i put the bad pictures up too , because there are bad pictures .
they ' re the largest of the tuna ##s , the second - largest fish in the sea - - bon ##y fish .
the european population and north african - - the eastern blue ##fin tuna - - is fish ##ed at tre ##men ##dou ##s levels : 50 , 000 tons over the last decade almost every year .
we basica ##lly are taking the same satellite phone parts , or the same parts that are in your computer , chips .
now , the activities from the lab have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean .
there are two villages , harris and more ##head city , every winter for over a decade , held a party called tag - a - giant , and together , fisher ##s worked with us to tag 800 to 900 fish .
these become forth ##right in places we need to protect .
the tuna team from topp has done the un ##thi ##nka ##ble : three teams tag ##ged 1 , 700 tuna ##s , blue ##fin , yellow ##fin and alba ##core all at the same time - - care ##fully re ##hea ##rse ##d tag ##ging programs in which we go out , pick up juvenile tuna ##s , put in the tag ##s that actually have the sensor ##s , stick out the tuna and then let them go .
we did this with the great turtle race - - tag ##ged turtles , brought in four million hits .
hi there . i ' m hasan . i ' m an artist .

this was on delta 719 going from j ##fk to san francisco .
all of these are extra ##cted directly from my bank accounts , and everything pop ##s up right away .
and on sunday , june 14th at 2009 - - this was actually about two o ' clock in the afternoon in sk ##ow ##he ##gan , maine - - this was my apartment there .
because no one ' s really watching .
he : well it goes to the last point that i was at .
and now , 2012 .
now , four years ago , chris lost his job , unfortunately , as an art buy ##er at mac ##y ' s , and like so many people , he struggled to find a new one during the rece ##ssion .
how do we mimi ##c the way trust is built face - to - face online ?
it was rid ##icu ##lou ##s . i couldn ' t get a mobile phone plan because my credit history didn ' t travel with me .
now the interesting thing is , reputation is the socio ##eco ##nomi ##c lub ##rica ##nt that makes collaborative consumption work and scale , but the sources it will be generated from , and its applications , are far bigger than this space alone .
there ' s been an explosion of collaborative consumption - - web - powered sharing of cars , apartments , skills . rachel bot ##sman explore ##s the currency that makes systems like air ##b ##nb and task ##rab ##bit work : trust , influence , and what she calls " reputation capital . "
now i ' m going to show you what that does to our societies .
it ' s simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trust ##ed .
but it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison .
the position of women , how closely they keep to the nuclear family , are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world .
but i should say a few words about what ' s going on .
and of course , others using more so ##phis ##tica ##ted methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on .
one of the key areas we ' ve been working on recently is medical devices , and while it may not be obvious that medical devices have something in common with iraq ' s electricity grid then , there are some common ##ali ##ties .
how do you ensure it gets to them and it improve ##s their lives ?
notice anything about it ?
the industry average is about 65 percent .
you ' ve got to pay for your soap , your deo ##dora ##nt , tooth ##bru ##sh , tooth ##pas ##te , all of it .
the best thing we can do is figure out ways to nur ##ture the entrepreneur ##ial spirit and the tre ##men ##dou ##s un ##ta ##ppe ##d potential in our prison ##s , because if we don ' t , they ' re not going to learn any new skills that ' s going to help them , and they ' ll be right back .
second of all , it ' s really beautiful ##ly balance ##d : it holds well , it feels well .
now , the weird thing is google lies , because if i type " design and emotion , " it says , " you don ' t need the ' and . ' we do it any ##way . "
now some people can - - circus workers , steel workers .
no big deal .
and behavioral design is all about feeling in control , which includes usa ##bility , understanding - - but also the feel and heft .
it ' s kind of nea ##t . what a wonderful design .
and that ' s what ' s nice about emotion .
but it was quite obvious , quite clear , that for this particular route that i had taken , the remote ##r the school was , the worse its results seemed to be .
any ##way , so i ' m propos ##ing that an alternative primary education , whatever alternative you want , is required where schools don ' t exist , where schools are not good enough , where teachers are not available or where teachers are not good enough , for whatever reason .
so he figure ##d that out . it took him over two minutes to figure out that he was doing things to the television .
so they said , " well , you ' ve left this machine which talks only in english , so we had to learn english . "
what could they learn to do ?
a typical example being , " sometimes it is necessary to tell lies . "
thank you .
and i , one day , i announced this to my parents - - and my father den ##ies this story to this day - - i said , " daddy , i want to be a diplomat . "
and any ##way , my tour - - it was kind of a very ex ##citi ##ng time .
second ##ly , the government had ign ##ored all available alternatives to war , which in some ways was a more disc ##redi ##table thing still .
my pension was in it .
why don ' t you ad ##vise their government on their diploma ##cy ? "
and one thing led to another , and i ended up having a desk in ? what if ! in new york , when i started independent diplomat .
what this means is it ' s no longer good enough to say that international relations , or global affairs , or chaos in somalia , or what ' s going on in burma is none of your business , and that you can leave it to governments to get on with .
and of course , everybody got it . everybody went , " yes , of course , you ' re absolute ##ly right .
it ' s that broken experience on the web .
so where this comes into play and why this is important is i head up a technology inc ##uba ##tor , and we had eight startu ##ps sitting around there .
so most everyone watch ##es tv .
animals might love to play , but they don ' t love to watch .
as we start , you see in 1960 inspiration is holding steady .
look at this green spike in 1966 to a bell ##wet ##her show .
gl ##amo ##rous and rich .
that ' s all great , right ?
and then she clar ##ified . she said , " you know what , i don ' t mean that it suck ##s . it means that i didn ' t understand a word of it .
because , you see , dna is like a blue ##print that tells living things what to make .
it kills me . i ' m not kidd ##ing .
or even worse , science education is becoming like that guy who always says , " actually . "
there ' s still so much work left to be done , though , and if you ' re involved with science in any way i ur ##ge you to join me .
but sometimes it ' s as though a door ##way appears from out of nowhere and it opens onto a sta ##ir ##case .
but here ' s the weird ##est place of all : war .
dur ##kh ##eim called this level the level of the sacred because he believed that the function of religion was to unite people into a group , into a moral community .
he said , " if the one tribe included a great number of courage ##ous , sy ##mpat ##hetic and faithful members who are always ready to aid and defend each other , this tribe would succeed better and con ##quer the other . "
and as you ' ll see in this simulation , as they intera ##ct they gain points , as it were , they grow , and when they ' ve double ##d in size , you ' ll see them split , and that ' s how they rep ##rod ##uce and the population grows .
it happened again about 120 or a 140 million years ago when some soli ##tary wasp ##s began creating little simple , primitive nest ##s , or hiv ##es .
i don ' t mean that we evolved to join gi ##ganti ##c organized religions .
and that gives me hope because people are not pure ##ly self ##ish .
so i realized then that i wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now .
here is another pretty typical scene . this is a suburban las vegas neighborhood .
and the thing you really hope for is occasionally they burn up , which we won ' t see tonight . so .
and this graffiti artist has come along , made this sign a little bit better , and then moved on .
and the more you try to think about it , the further the answer gets from you , and the minute you stop thinking about it , your int ##uit ##ion gives you that answer , in a sense .
that was it . that ' s all he saw as the options . and not too far off .
and it was purpose ##ly done to look fairly serious .
this is how the ad ran throughout the world ; germany made one sl ##ight change in the ad .
the cove ##ted right - hand page was not given up to the whole issue .
what ' s next ? what ' s next is going to be people .
and if you would , you ' ve got a great job .
something , again , that went back to something more fundamental .
this is another version of that . this is a sea dragon , and the one on the bottom , the blue one , is a juvenile that has not yet sw ##allo ##wed the acid , has not yet taken in the brown - green al ##gae pond sc ##um into its body to give it energy .
they never touch the inner matter . there is more and more co - evolution .
and he has decided to treat them as if they were tri ##lo ##bit ##es , or snail ##s , and to do a mor ##ph ##ological analysis , and try to derive their gene ##alog ##ical history over time .
so we ' ve all heard about the amis ##h giving up cars .
and so a hammer , when we grab a hammer , that ' s what we ' re grab ##bing .
and if you play that well , you ' ll have other people involved , so even that game extends and continues even when you ' re gone .
and while a student at hawaii , i worked at the wai ##ki ##ki aquarium .
it ' s been a good ride .
so we created a way to find out , and i got my first look at that famous be ##ak in action .
and over the tops of them is 3 , 000 to 4 , 000 meters of water creating eno ##rm ##ous pressure , forcing water down through the crack ##s toward the center of the earth , until it hits a magma chamber where it becomes super ##hea ##ted and super ##sat ##urat ##ed with minerals , reverse ##s its flow and starts shooting back to the surface and is eje ##cted out of the earth like a ge ##yse ##r at yellow ##stone .
and that ep ##hem ##eral nature of the hydro ##ther ##mal vent community isn ' t really different from some of the areas that i ' ve seen in 35 years of traveling around , making films .
and a small group of thought ##ful people changed that bay .
now , sylvia ' s ted prize wish was to bes ##ee ##ch us to do anything we could , everything we could , to set aside not pin pri ##cks , but significant ex ##pan ##ses of the ocean for preservation , " hope spots , " she calls them .
now the rules that i ' m talking about are constantly being monitor ##ed by the culture .
and then i thought - - in my 40 ##s i started thinking , " well , why don ' t i do something ?
here ' s some numbers .
you could drop an atom bomb on a city , and 30 years later it ' s surviving .
so let ' s first talk about biology .
so is london a scale ##d up birmingham , which is a scale ##d up brighton , etc . , etc . ?
and we ' ve looked at everything : more aids cases , fl ##u , etc .
that would be bad for economie ##s and cities .
but you notice , i ' ve che ##ated , because i ' ve only gone up to ' 94 .
right about the time that the internet gets going as an educational tool , i take off from wisconsin and move to kansas , small town kansas , where i had an opportunity to teach in a lovely , small - town , rural kansas school district , where i was teaching my favorite subject , american government .
but what was interesting about this position i found myself in in arizona , was i had this really in a truly public school , and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities .
that is the absolute wrong thing to ask , to tell kids to never be wrong .
and when we do another round of this in my class this year , they will do better this time , because learning has to include an amount of failure , because failure is instruction ##al in the process .
it ' s simply acc ##eler ##ating the pace at which the body he ##als itself to a clinical ##ly relevant times ##cale .
41 people who were basica ##lly outside of being really sick , paying for the one retire ##e who was ex ##peri ##enci ##ng deb ##ili ##tati ##ng disease .
if a new ##t can do this kind of thing , why can ' t we ?
therefore , if we can find the right cells and imp ##lant them in the body , they may do the healing .
and that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response that it didn ' t have before .
it ' s the cool ##est stuff .
it ' s a great source of stem cells .
it ' s very powerful work .
thank you .
oh , wonderful .
and - - oh , i saw gold ##ie ha ##wn .
it ' s true . it ' s true .
but then on top of that , you know , sarah jones told me we only have 18 minutes .
so , we dese ##rve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else .
my name is prave ##en man ##vi and thank you very much for this opportunity .
my son , he says he is not ready to get married .
so i think maybe ted , you impact people ' s lives in the ways maybe even you don ' t reali ##ze .
that ' s all , shu ##kra ##n . thank you very much for the opportunity .
but i ' m actually here today to tell a story .
i started a couple of businesses that i thought would be the ticket to financial freedom .
but there ' s also a lot of people that you don ' t know .
and we don ' t just want people to see our movies and say , that was fun , and forget about it .
we ' ve sent 50 , 000 dvd ##s to high school teachers in the u . s .
and finally , an eb ##ay listing for one well - traveled slide show , now ob ##sol ##ete , museum piece . please contact al gore .
believe it or not , some of us do survive .
it ' s been tape ##d with tape that we even stopped using in the u . k .
equipment that ' s ob ##sol ##ete , equipment that doesn ' t quite work , or it works and you can ' t fix it . and there ' s nothing wrong with that , so long as we use it and we move on .
that ' s what he was doing , prop ##ping up the bed because the bed simply didn ' t work .
these are the basic features of my device , or our device .
this was a huge impact on my mind , because i am a woman and i am a mother , and i had ##n ' t realized that the hiv / aids pan ##dem ##ic was directly affect ##ing women in such a way .
i ' ve traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years - - i went to about 12 different countries .
ave ##lil ##e had the virus , she was born with the virus .
our enemies shall talk themselves to death , and we will fight them with their own confusion .
but over ##th ##row ##ing a government is one thing and building a stable democracy is a bit more complicated .
you have a situation where the relationship between government and local social network ##ing companies is creating a situation where , effectively , the em ##power ##ing potential of these platforms is being con ##stra ##ined because of these relationships between companies and government .
and here in the united kingdom there ' s also concern over a law called the digital economy act that ' s placing more onu ##s on private intermedia ##ries to police citizen behavior .
but in the last two decades , it has experienced an un ##pre ##ced ##ented expansion , now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world ' s gdp .
the court system wasn ' t function ##ing properly .
the zones of production and distribution tend to lie in the developing world , and they are often threatened by app ##all ##ing violence and blood ##shed .
so i have shown you this to demonstrate how many boats , how many vessels it takes to catch one of these guys .
now , i was taken by inspector brian cant ##era , of the royal canadian mounted police , to a cave ##rno ##us warehouse east of vancouver to see some of the goods which are regularly con ##fis ##cated by the rc ##mp from the sm ##ug ##gler ##s who are sending it , of course , down south to the united states where there is an insa ##tia ##ble market for b . c . bud , as it ' s called , in part because it ' s market ##ed as organic , which of course goes down very well in california .
hook ##ed it up to my lap ##top , and within about five minutes he had pen ##etra ##ted the computer security system of a major brazilian bank .
there is no romance involved with gangster ##s in the 21st century .
everybody knew the answer .
you ' ve believed it through generations .
all his colleagues said , " this is outra ##ge ##ous .

ah , mark - - ser ##fa ##as .
i ' d basica ##lly dis ##tille ##d a very difficult - to - explain and complex philosophy , which i won ' t get into here , because it ' s a little too deep for all of you , but - - it ' s about what makes websites popular , and , you know , it ' s - - it ' s un ##fort ##una ##te that i don ' t have more time .
and frog mode .
it ' s the process of creation that keeps me sort of a bubble and a half above per ##pet ##ual an ##xie ##ty in my life , and it ' s that feeling of being about 80 percent complete on a project - - where you know you still have something to do , but it ' s not finished , and you ' re not starting something - - that really fills my entire life .
i think that the " now tied up , tied down , mistress cruel approaches me , now tied down , it ' s up . "

so when you do that , here ' s what i can promise : you ' re going to be the 800 pound gorilla in the forest .
and so i went home , and i made a prototype of this hat .
and i thought , " well , hey !
this very basic shift in my physical orientation helped me shift my perspective in relation to the glacier .
yet we dit ##her , taking no action to def ##lec ##t the asteroid , even though the longer we wait , the more difficult and expensive it becomes . "
our problem and our tragedy is that in these hyper - partisan times , the mere fact that one side says , " look , there ' s an asteroid , " means that the other side ' s going to say , " hu ##h ? what ?
it causes them to dis ##tor ##t reality .
so , how warm or cold do you feel about , you know , native americans , or the military , the republican party , the democratic party , all sort ##s of groups in american life .
but the problem isn ' t primarily that we ' re elect ##ing bad people to congress .
so here ' s another asteroid .
when americans go to college and marry each other , they have very low divorce rates .
and most sur ##pris ##ingly to me , they sometimes can even see eye to eye on criminal justice .
and this is the conversion of one group of substances into another , either through the production or the absorption of energy .
so what we ' re trying to do is , we ' re trying to push these technologies towards creating bottom - up construction approaches for architecture , which contrast the current , victorian , top - down methods which impose structure upon matter .
now , this is the very interesting part .
venice is sin ##king . to save it , rachel armstrong says we need to out ##gro ##w architecture made of ine ##rt materials and , well , make architecture that grows itself . she proposes a not - quite - alive material that does its own repairs and se ##ques ##ters carbon , too .
i ' m scar ##ed . tell them to get away . ' " as a young woman , i was in a psychiatric hospital on three different occasions for length ##y periods .

this episode led to my first hospital ##ization in america .
they would ##n ' t experience rest ##rain ##ts as we would . "
' oka ##y . small . fire on ice . tell them not to kill me .
so let me share some final thoughts .
when i turned 18 , i lost my best friend to a car accident .
second it ' s driving itself .
they ' re the veins of the eco ##system , and they ' re often empty veins .
and i ' m sure you all know , this has created significant conflicts between the agricultural and environmental communities .
but they have no ince ##nti ##ve to do so .
with streams and rivers dry ##ing up because of over - usage , rob harm ##on has implemented an ingen ##ious market mechanism to bring back the water . farmers and beer companies find their fate ##s inter ##tw ##ined in the intr ##igu ##ing century - old tale of pri ##ck ##ly pea ##r creek . & lt ; em & gt ; & lt ; / em & gt ;
but , yeah .
he ' s by far the hap ##pies ##t man ever measured by science .
and maybe because of that , comp ##ass ##ion is organic and widespread company - wide .
so what are they ?
so this mutual inspiration promote ##s collaboration , initiative and creat ##ivity .
attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities .

and it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implement ##ing these laws .
and with that , he successfully organized 68 lawyers who have been systematic ##ally taking the cases .
and i was sitting side by side with one of our very courage ##ous lawyers , and said , " how can we get this out ? how can we make sure that this is implemented ?
so i thank you for having the prophet ##ic imagination to imagine the sha ##ping of a new world with us together , and invite you into this journey with us .
you know when they do home ##works at home ?
it can be a school of design in jerusalem that tries to find a better way to design gas mask ##s for people , because , as you know , israel de ##ploy ##s one gas mask per person including bab ##ies .
hell ##a jonge ##rius is a person that is able to make a synthesis that is really quite amazing and also quite hil ##ario ##us .
so , designers sometimes don ' t do things that are immediately functional , but they ' re functional to our understanding of issues .
and that makes sense .
but i ' m going to try and do something different , and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories , and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we ' ve been talking about .
and what happened was , because they could af ##ford it sometimes , sometimes not , i got kick ##ed out pretty much every term .
my father , who i ' ve been talking about , died of aids in 1999 .
how would you look at me ?
so we need to start getting better .
and i can ' t em ##pha ##siz ##e that enough , you know .
you know , they ' re not going to change just out of nowhere .
a cousin of mine died of aids , left an or ##pha ##n , so we said , well , what are we going to do with her ?
and this is just an illustration .
long distance running was not only good for my well - being but it helped me medi ##tate and dream big .
but for every disaster we had , the marathon found ways to bring people together .
i believe these are the building blocks for future peace .

so these are my daughters .
most of the people who lived here either lived in coastal villages , fishing , or were nom ##ads who ro ##ame ##d around with the environment trying to find water .
this is probably the sky ##line that most of you know about doha .
energy is the key factor here . it changed everything .
these risks directly affect the sus ##tain ##ability of this nation and its continu ##ity .
imagine a country with abundant power - - oil and gas , sunshine , wind - - but missing one key essential for life : water . infrastructure engineer fa ##had al - atti ##ya talks about the unexpected ways that the small middle eastern nation of qatar creates its water supply .
i ' ll try where it all started in the middle east , and for so many years we were living with completely the wrong perception of the middle east .
you see nine presidential candidates running against lukas ##hen ##ko .
so there are so many things you can do instead of getting into one place , sho ##uting and showing off in front of the security forces .
it is true that the internet and new media are very useful in making things faster and cheap ##er .
2011 was a year of extraordinary people - powered resistance , starting with arab spring and spread ##ing across the world . how did this resistance work so well ? sr ##dja pop ##ovic lay ##s out the plans , skills and tools each movement needs - - from non ##vio ##lent tactics to a sense of humor . & lt ; em & gt ; & lt ; / em & gt ;

shame feels the same for men and women , but it ' s organized by gender .
you show me a man who can sit with a woman who ' s just had it , she can ' t do it all any ##more , and his first response is not , " i un ##loaded the dish ##was ##her , " but he really listen ##s - - because that ' s all we need - - i ' ll show you a guy who ' s done a lot of work .
it is a dream of man ##kind to fly like a bird .
we have to turn it , go up and go down .

dr . v : see , mcdonald ' s ' concept is simple .
the effect of this has been that , within the first year , we really had a 40 percent pen ##etra ##tion in the market that it served , which is over 50 , 000 people .
the revenue ##s increase at a higher level , giving us a healthy margin while you ' re treat ##ing a large number of people for free .
now , how do you make people own the problem , want to do something about it ?
it is a mobile phone - shaped box that has an iron weight inside , which we can move around , and you can feel where it ' s heavy .
as humans , we are social , we are empat ##hic , and that ' s great .
but even though i had this new ##fo ##und joy and freedom , people ' s reaction completely changed towards me .
for me , this means that they ' re seeing the value of difference , the joy it brings when instead of focusing on loss or limita ##tion , we see and discover the power and joy of seeing the world from ex ##citi ##ng new perspectives .
but even more striking than the fer ##ocio ##us power eman ##ating from that well was the rec ##kles ##snes ##s with which that power was un ##lea ##shed - - the care ##less ##ness , the lack of planning that characterized the operation from dr ##illing to clean - up .
a range of explanation ##s may be pop ##ping into your mind by now , like " gre ##ed . "

could you just push that ?

the design of the body is a whole different thing .
dh : tell them about our bio and stuff .

i ' ll spend a fortune on it . i ' ve got a better idea .
if you ' ve ever seen an electron micro ##scope picture , you ' ll see this . this all looks the same , then there ' s this bit over here which is inc ##redi ##bly complicated .

these coral ##s can be quite kind of mean , you see , and i have surf ##ing scar ##s to prove that .
and things can happen only if these interactions are perfect ##ly balance ##d .
finally , there ' s the force of gravity , which intera ##cts with matter via its mass and spin .
so the electro ##ma ##gnet ##ic and weak forces are described by this pattern of particle charges in two - dimensional space .
from this pattern , we already know the particle physics of these tiny scales . the way the universe works with these tiny scales is very beautiful .
each point in this pattern correspond ##s to a sy ##mme ##try of this very complex and beautiful shape .
if the l ##hc finds new particles , but they don ' t fit this pattern - - well , that will be very interesting , but bad for this e ##8 theory .
but not wo ##rry ##ing about rent allowed me to spend my time doing what i love .
i don ' t know if i ' ll be able to make this any clear ##er .
so it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chim ##pan ##zee ##s are so like us , in certain aspects of their behavior .
so it ' s pretty sad to find that chim ##pan ##zee ##s , like so many other creatures around the world , are losing their habitats .
they were interested in health ; they were interested in education .
the water - - water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues that we ' re going to face in this century - - and every ##w ##here water is being poll ##uted by agricultural , industrial and household chemicals that still are being sp ##ray ##ed around the world , seem ##ingly with the ina ##bility to profit from past experience .
see the brick wall as all these problems we ' ve inf ##lic ##ted on the planet , environmental and social . it ' s a message of hope .

and even though there is food that we are producing at great cost , we don ' t actually value it .
the answer is what i call " ancient food miles . "
and , in fact , if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age , you can trace food coming in to it .
and this really is the moment when our relationship , both with food and cities , changes completely .
