you know , one of the great ties in traveling and one of the joys in ethnic research is to live together with the people who can remember the old days , who still feel their past in the wind , touching them on rain - rocks , taste in the bitter leaves of the plants .
just knowing that jaguar shamans are still travel beyond the milky way , or the importance of the myths of the ancestors of the inuit are still important , or that in the himalayas , the buddhists are still carrying the breath of dharma , means remember the central revelation of anthropology , is the idea that the world that we live in doesn ' t exist in an absolute sense , but only as a model of reality , as a consequence of a group of certain ways of adapta that our ancestors , although successfully , many generations ago .
and of course , we all share the same adaptations .
we ' re all born . we re birth children . we
we go through initiation ceremonies .
we have to deal with the unitoprupted separation of death , and so we shouldn ' t be surprise that we all sing , dance and produce art .
but what ' s interesting is the unique tone of song , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn ' t matter whether it ' s the penan in the forests of borneo , or the voodoo acolytes in haiti , or the warriors in the cay desert of northern kenya , the curanderos in the alaska , or a karawan in the middle of the sahara . this happens to be the colleague who i traveled to the desert a month ago , or even a yak shepherd at the tops of the qomolangma , everest , the mother of the world . the . it this i traveled of
all of these people teach us that there are different posbilities existence , different ways of existence , different ways of guidance on earth .
and this is an idea that , if you think about it , can only fulfill you with hope .
together , the thousandsless cultures of the world form a web of spiritual and cultural life that surroundates the earth and is as important for the welfare of the earth as the biological lifesystem that you know as a biosphere .
you can think of this cultural life web as an ethphere , and ethosphere can be defined as the total sum of all the thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations and intuitions that have produced by human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
the ethosphere is humanity ' s great legacy .
it ' s the symbol of all what we are and what we can do as an amazingishingably knowledge species .
and just as the biosphere was been degrade out a lot , this happened with the ethosphere - only at even greater speed . and
no biologist would dare to say that 50 percent or more of all species are just about to extinction , because it ' s just not true . and yet , this - the most apocalyptic scenario in the of biodiversity - correspond hardly to what we know known to as an optimistic scenario in the field of cultural diversity . and for that for no a
and the crucial indicator of this is the extinction of languages .
when each of you born in this room , 6 , 000 languages spoken on earth .
now a language is not just the sum of the vocabulary or a set of grammar rules .
a language is an expression of the human mind .
it ' s a means by which the soul of a particular culture to find access to the physical world .
each language is like an old - fashion forest of the mind , a turning point , an thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and of those 6 , 000 languages today , while we ' re sitting here in monterey , half them are no longer whispered into the ears of children . and
they ' re no not taughtsmore , which means , if nothing is done , they ' re actually already dead .
what could be lonelyr than covered silence of being one of the last of your people speak your language , to have no way to pass the wisdom of your ancestors , or the hope of exng children ?
and yet this terriblele fate actually happen happens to someone somewhere on earth about every two weeks , because every two weeks , an older person dies and takes the last syllables of an old language into the grave . and
and i know that some of you say , " isn ' t it better ? " wouldn the world not be a better place if we all speak one language ? " and i say , " well , let this language be yoruba . let them be bayan . be a
let them be kogi . "
and then you would suddenly realize what it would be like if you couldn ' t speak your own language .
so today i want to kind sort of take you on a journey through the eth , a quick journey through the atmosphere to try to make you understand what ' has actually been lost . so . so
now , there are some of us who kind of forget that when i say , " different ways of being , i mean really different ways of being .
for example , take this child of the barasana in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the anaconsa people , believe that they mythologically came the milk stream from the east in the belly of sacred snakes . for
this is a people who don ' t cognitively distinguish between the colors blue and green because the sky row is equal to the forest that people depend on . this
they have a strange language , and a marriage rule is called the linguistic epigumy : you have to marry someone somebody who speaks a different language .
all of this is rooted in the mythological past , and the strange thing about these big houses where six or seven languages are spoken because of differences , is that you never hear anyone learns a language . but
they just listen and then start talking .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes i ' ve ever lived with , the waorani in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people who was first peacefully contacted in 1958 .
in 1957 , five missionaries were trying to contact and made a serious mistake .
they took gly pictures of themselves out from the air , which we would consider be a friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people from the rainforests in their life had never seen anything two - dimensional .
they took up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see behind the face or the figure , found find anything and concluded that these were business cards of the devil , and killed the five missionaries with the spear . they . they
but the waorani didn ' t just kill outside with the spear .
they drilled into each other .
54 percent of the deaths were caused from drilling .
we studied the gene data for eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people something about it with repeated pressure , they admitted that one of the people had gott become so old that he died because of his age , and we still killed him with the spear .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest that which was amazing .
their hunters could smell the urine of an animal from 40 miles away and determine which animal of that belonged to .
in the early ' 80s , i got a really amazing task when my professor at harvard asked me if i was interested in going to haiti and infferiring the secret societies that were the foundation of the strength of dulaine and tonton macoutes and the poison that was used to make zombies . in really in the
in order to make sense of this sensation , of course , i had to know something about this remarkable belief of vodoun , and voodoo is not a cult of black magic . of
on the contrary , it ' s a complex metaphysical worldview .
it ' s interesting . it
if i asked you to tell the great world religions , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , judaism , or whatever .
a continent is always left , because the presumption was that there sub - africa there was no religious faith in , of course there was one , and voodoo is just the legacy of these very deep religious ideas that came along over the tragic diaspora of slavey .
but what makes voodoo so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead . but
the living give birth the spirits . the
the spirits can be spelld by under the great water , answers to the rhythm of the dance to temporarily display the soul of the living , so that the acolyth glowi becomes god for a brief moment .
and the thingb , the voodooists like to say , " you white people go to the church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . "
and because you ' re obsessed , you ' re taken by the mind . how can you harm damage to you ?
look at these amazing demonstrations : voodoo acolytess in a trance smraying burningowing coal without burning , an amazing representation of the ability of the mind to affect the body so that it prevents it when it ' s put into a state of extreme arousal .
now , of all the people i ' ve met the kogi from the sierra nevada de santa mart in northern colombia were the most extraordinary ones .
descendants of the ancient tyrannian civilization that colonhabized the caribbean coast of colombia , and as a result of the conquest , these people retreat back into an isolated volcanic mass that rises above the caribbean coast plain .
in a blood - filled continent , these people were the only people who were never conquered by the spanish .
to this day , they are re governed by a ritual priesthood , but the education to priesthood is very extraordinary .
the young acolytess are separated three from their families at age and years and separated in a shadowy world of darkness , separated in stone huts at the base of the glaciers for 18 years , two periods of nine years deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of pregnancy they spent in the of their own mothers , now metamorphorically in the lap of the great mother ' . the oflly . the ' .
and throughout all this time , they ' re culturally introduced into the values of their society , values that maintain the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic - or we could say , maintain the ecological - balance .
at the end of this amazing initiation , one day suddenly are taken out , and for the first time in your life , at the age of 18 , you see a sunset , and in this crystallized moment of first light , as the sun begins to shine to the hills of the astonishingly beautiful landscape , suddenly of a sudden everything you ' ve learned in abstract confirmed in amazingishing glory , and the priest comes back and says , " you see ? it ' s really how i told you .
it ' s so wonderful . you have to protect it . "
they call themselves the older brothers , and they say that we the younger brothers , are responsible for the destruction of the world . they .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
every time we think about indigenous and landscape , we either condem rousseau and the old mythor of the noble wild , which in its simpli , is a racist thought , or a thoreau and say , these people are more connected to nature than we do .
so , infants are not sentimental , or are they weakened by nostalgia .
there ' s not much room for in the malaria - poison swamps of ashmat or the cold winds of tibet , but they ' ve still , through time and ritual , shaped a mysterious nimbus of the earth not based on the idea of being close to , but on a much more subtle intuition , the idea that the earth can exist itself exist because it ' s breathed into human consciousness . of the can the it ' there it . it . the . it
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little child from the alaska growing up in the belief that the mountain is an apu spirit who determine being or her destiny will become a very different person , and have a different relationship with that resource or this place than a little kid from montana growing up in the belief that a mountain is a bunch of rocks that can be erominatted . it
whether it ' s a place of a mind or a bunch of mineral , it is s irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor , which defines the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of british colombia , believing believed that these forests were there to be mined .
that made me another person than my friends among the kwakiut who believe that these forests are the location of hukuk and the curved skybar and the cannibal spirits who live in the northern of the world , spirits that who would participate in their hamataa initiation .
now , when you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries - for this plant here .
it ' s a photograph i just took last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psychoactive drug from the repertoire of shaman .
what makes ayahuasca so fascinating is not just the pharmacological potential of this drug , but its processing . it ' s really made from two different sources . on the one hand , there ' s this wooden lemon that contains a series of betacarbolgens , harmin , harmolin , light hallucinoggens - taking this climbing plant alone is kind of like if a blue scockoy puts smoke on its consciousness , but it ' s mixed with the leaves of a strp from the family of coffee plants called psychotria viridis . mixed with the leaves of mixed leaves of the of . taking s , of a that contains . there ' is of ,
this plant contains some very strong tryptamines that are similar to serotonin , dimethtryptamine - 5 and methoymethtryptamine . this
if you ' ve seen the yanomami sniffing this stuff , this substance that they make from different species also contains methoxyymethyltryylamine . if
sning this powder is kind of like being shot out of a gun , surroundeded by renaissance paintings and landing on a sea of electricity .
it ' s not a distortion of reality , it ' s a resolution of reality . it
in fact , i talk discussed this with my professor , richard evan shultes , the man who initiated the psychedelic area with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the 30s , and i argued that you couldn ' t classify these tryptamine as hallucinoges , because the moment you feel the impact , you ' re not there to experience a hallucination .
but the thing about tryptamine is that they can ' t be orally because they ' re denaized by a enzyme gut in human gut called monoamine - oxidase . but
they can only be taken in combination with a number of other chemicals orally that denarupture the mao .
now the fascinating thing is that the betacar drugs that are contained in the stigy are mao inhibitors of exactly the kind necessary to avoid the tryptamine . so ask yourself . now
how can these people from a species of 80 , 000 species of ading plants find these two morphologically relatedted plants that , if combined in this way , create a kind of biochemical version so that the whole is larger than the sum of its parts ? how
we use this great metaphor , trial and error , which turns out to be meaningless .
but you ask the indians they say , " the plant speaks to us . "
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasca , that you all see at a long distance in the forest that appear to our eyes like a species . this
and then you ask them how to explain their taxonomi , and they say , " i thought you understand something about plants .
i mean , don ' you know anything all ? " and i said , " no . "
so , it turns out you take each of these 17 variations on full moon , and they sing to you in a different tone . so
now , that doesn ' t give you a ph . d . at harvard , but it ' s much more interesting than counting stamina .
now the problem - the problem is that even those of us who have sympathy for the difficult situation of indigenous people think of them as orgsell and colorful , but kind of rest limit them to the past , as the real world , which is our world moving .
so , the fact is that the 20th century , 300 years will not will remember for your wars or technological innovations 300 , but rather an era when we had retreat and actively supported the massive destruction of earth ' s biological and cultural diversity or passively accepted the . so the problem is not change .
all cultures have kept involved in the dance with new ways .
and the problem is not technology itself .
the sioux indians heard no less being sioux when they took on bows and arrow , when the americans stopped being americans when they took horses and horse horses . the .
not change and technology are threaten the integrity of the racephere . it ' s power . - the ugly face of rule .
and wherever you look around the world , you ' ll discover that these cultures are not dedicated to decline . these are dynamically living peoples whose existence is displaced by recniious forces that gone beyond their capacity to adaptation , whether it ' s the tremendous deforestation in the penan homeland , a nomadic people from southeast asia , from sarawak , a people who lived in the forest a generation , and now humted into joke and prostitution on the river , where you can see that even the river isminat with the mud that seems almost half borneo into south borneo sea , from where the japanese ships are on the horizon , who are ready to fill their shiplands with raw tree trunk that they ' ve migped off the forest , or , in the case of the yanomami , where they are path have migped during the gold rush .
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i ' m studying a lot of recently , you ' ll see the ugly face of political dominance . or
you know , the genocide , the phyic extinction of people , is generally convicted , but the ethnic , the destruction of people ' s lives , is not only not convicted , but general and many as part of a development strategy .
and you can ' t understand the suffering tibet if you haven ' t experienced it at the bottom .
i once went traveled with a young colleague 6 , 000 miles from chengdu in west china across southeast tibet to lhasa , and it wasn ' t until i got to lhasa that i saw the face behind the statistics you hear - 6 , 000 sacred monuments that were turned into rubble and ash - , 1 . 2 million people who were murdered by the tibetans during the cultural revolution . cultural revolution . i once i murdered
the father of this young man was identified as the followers of the panchen lama .
that meant that killed during the chinese invasion he was killed immediately .
his uncle fled with their holiness to the diaspora that brought people to nepal .
his mother was locked as a punishment for - to be wealthy for the crime .
he was smuggled into prison at the age of two years to hide under her rock rod , because she couldn ' t live without him .
the sister who did this brave act was taken to an education camp .
one day , she accidentally walked on a wrband hand , and for that hyper , she had to go to a heavy work camp for seven years .
the suffering of tibet can be insabeaable , but people ' s transati mind is something memorable . the
and at the end , we really have a choice : do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monoty or a polychromatic world of diversity ? and
margaret mead , the great anthropologist said before she died , said that her greatest fear is that as we move towards a tangt , shapeless , creative worldview , we would not only see the entire range of human imagination reduced to a riged way of thinking , but that day we wake up from a dream , and forgotten that there have ever other possibilities .bilities .
and it ' s humbling to think that maybe our species has been around for 600 , 000 years . and
the neolithic revolution that brought us agriculture us , and at this moment subsided the cult of the seed of wood , which replaced the poetry of shaman with the poetry of priesthood and created hierarchy , specialization and surplus - took happened only 10 , 000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn ' t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we face in the next millennia .
when we ask these countless world cultures about the importance of being human , they answer with 10 , 000 different voices .
and in this song , we ' re going toiscover the possibility to be what we are : people with full consciousness who are aware of the importance that all people and gardens need to growrive a space , and there are great moments of optimism . and this and .
here ' s a photograph i took on the northern end of the baffin islands , i was going on the narwhal hunt with inuits , and this man , olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government hasn ' t always dealt very well with the inuit very well , and during the 50 , establishing of our rule , they were forced to move into settlements .
the grandfather of this old man grandfather refused .
the family , who was afraid of his life took off all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit are not afraid of the cold . they used it to their advantage .
the side rod of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribbeanbu skin .
the man ' s grandfather was not afraid of the arctic night or the blow storm .
heped out , dropped his pants out of sea sl , and he rolled in his hand , and as the feces started freezing , he shaped them into the form of a knife .
he sprayed sp on the sides of the fece knife , and when it was completely frozen , he killed a dog with it . and
he unlealed the dog and improvised a dish , took the dog ' s skeleton , improvised a sledge , grabbed another dog andpeded over the ice caps with the fece knife on the belt .
that ' s how you can t make something out of anything .
and this , in many ways , is a symbol of the resistance of the inuit and all the indigenouss in the world . and
the canadian government gave the inuit in april 1999 full control over an area bigger than california and texas combined .
it ' s our new homeland , and it ' s called thevut . it
it ' s an independent area . they control all the mineral resources .
an amazing example of how a nation , a state that can look and rec with its people .
and finally , i think it ' s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who have traveled to these distant targets on the earth , to realize that they ' re not isolated at all . and
they ' re somebody ' s countries .
they represent parts of the human imagination that go back in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the geography of hope .
what we ' re trying at national is that we think that politicians are never do anything .
we believe that pole - we believe that pole isn ' t persuasive , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , so we are re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website gets 35 million hits every month . we
166 nations are sending our television channel .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we ' re doing a series of trips into the eth where we take our audience to places of such cultural wonders that they ' re blinded by what we seen , and hopefully one after other will take the central revelation of anthropology : that this world has deserved to exist in different ways , that we can find a way in a really multicultural pluralistic world where the wisdom of all people can contribute to our shared well - being . and . and . and . we ways , where the

what i ' m going to show you , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we gave microsoft as part of an acquisition just a year ago , which is seamount , and it ' s an environment where you can either deal locally or remote with huge amounts of visual data . what
we see many , many gigabits of digital photos here that can be seamlessly and continuously , in any way . we .
and it doesn ' t matter how much information we look at , how big these collections are , or how big the images are .
most of them are digital photos of a camera , but this example , is , this is a scan from the library of congress , and it ' s in 300 megapixels .
it doesn ' t make any difference , because the only thing that can restte the performance of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen at each moment , and it also has a very flexible architecture . it
this is a whole book , an example of non - image data .
this is bleak house by dickens . each column is a chapter .
to prove that it ' s really a text and not an image , we can do something like that to really show that this is a real representation of the text and not an image .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading an e - book .
i wouldn ' t recommend it .
this is a more realistic case . this is a the guardian .
every big image is the beginning of a section .
and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience of reading a real paper copy of a magazine or a newspaper , which is in fact a kind of multiple scales of medium . and
we also did something at the corner of this particular the guardian .
we designed a false display with very high resolution which is much higher than a normal display , and we added more content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and this really grabs these ideas to eliminate these constraints for the available place on the screen .
we hope that doesn ' t mean pop - ups and other nonsense anymore - that shouldn ' t be necessary . we
of course , mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i really don ' t want to spend a lot of time here except say that we ' re going to contribute to this area as well .
but these are all the streets in the u . s .
stacked at the top of the earth ' s image nasa .
let ' s get out something else now .
this is actually live on the internet . you can check it .
this is a project called photosynth , which really connects two different technologies together .
one is seamouon , and the other is a very good research on computer vision done by noah snavely , a of washington student , under guidance of steve seitz at the uw .
and rick szeliski at microsoft research done . - a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it ' s powered by seamouon .
you can see this when we create these kinds of views where we can penetrate through images and have this experience of multi resolution .
but the spatial arrangement of the images actually matters here .
the computer vision algorithms have captured these images together so that they correspond to the real space in where these images are all taken near the grassi lakes in the canadian rockies , and you see at elements of stabilized slides or panoramic imaging , and these things have all spatially related to . have
i don ' t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are ones that are much more spatial .
i ' d like to go straight one of the original data sets of noah , and this is from an early prototype of photosynth that we first worked in the summer to show you what i think is really the punchline behind this technology , photosynth technology , and this is ' not t necessarily that obvious when you look at the environments that we have on the website . i
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral of notre dame which was taken only on the computer with images from flickr . just put notre into flickr , and you ' ll get images of men in t - shirts and in the university building and so on , and each of these orange cone represents a picture that has been discovered as to this model .
so these are all flickr images , and they ' re all in to each other in way .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that eventually i ' m going to work at microsoft .
i ' m very grateful for the reception here .
i guess you can see that these are many different kinds of cameras : everything is there from the mobile phone camera to professional slrs , a pretty large number of them that have all been plugged together in this environment .
and if possible , i ' will ll find some of the strange ones . and
many of them are covered by faces and so on .
somewhere here are a series of photographs - here they are .
this is actually a poster of notre dame that was actually recorded .
we can go from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment , . and there ' s now collected data from everybody - from the entire collective store of what how , visually the earth looks like - and everything is connected to each other . and .
all these photos are connected together to each other , and there creates something bigger than the sum of the parts .
you get a model that comes out of the earth .
think of this as the sequel to stephen lawlers ' s on virtual earth .
and this is something that grows because of the complexity that people are use it and its benefit for the user is bigger .
their own photos are marked with metadata that another person has type in .
if someone has took the effort and labeled all these saints and explains who they are all , then my photo of the cathedral will suddenly filled with all this data , and i can use it as a starting to dive into this room , into this metaph that use photos of other people , and create a kind of broad modal social experience with the using other providers . experience . other .
and of course , byproduct of all of this is the enormously rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that have been preserved not just through flights or satellite images and so on , but through by collective memories . and
thank you . thank
do i understand right ? your software allows you , at a certain point , over the next few years , all the images used by someone in the world are basically connected linked together ?
yes . it she does nothing but discover .
if you want , it createslinks between the images .
and it does it because of the content in the pictures .
and that ' s really exciting when you think about the abundance of the semantic information that a lot of these images have . and
like if you ' re doing a web search for images where you type sentences , and the text of the website contains a lot of information about which image that is .
but what if the image connects you to all your images ?
then the amount of semantic cross wiring and the abundance that comes out of it is really enormous . it ' s a classic network effect .
blaise , that ' s really incredible . thank you congratus .
thank you very much .
i ' m going to tell you some things from my book that i hope are in harmony with other things that you ' ve heard before , and i ' m going to try to make a few connections yourself if you haven ' t noticed them . i
i want to start with what i call " official dogma . "
the official dogma of what ?
the official belief of all western industrialized societies .
the official dogma works like this : if our goal is to maximizeizing the common good of our citizens , it ' s all by maximizing the freedom of the individual . the .
the reason for that is that freedom is good itself , valuable , meaningful , an essential condition for human .
if people have freedom , each of us is about doing the things that maximize our common good , and no nobody has to decide for us .
the way toize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more common good they have .
this , i think , is so deeply embedded in our water supply that no would think to question it .
and it ' s also deeply embedded in our lives .
i ' m going to give you some examples of what enable us make modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no bigger one .
i just want to talk a little bit about lettuce suite .
there are 175 dressders in my supermarket store , if you don ' t count the 10 different extra olive oil and 12 different balsam acids that you could buy to make a large amount of salad , in the unlikely case that none of the 175 in the store is right for you .
so this is what the supermarket is .
and then they go to the consumer electronics business to assemble a stereo - speakers , cd - player , cassette player , radio , amplifier - and in this electronics business , there are so many stereos . and
we can putmble 6 . 5 million different stereos of the components that are offered in this business . we
you have to admit that this ' s a big choice . you
in other areas , the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , where you could have any phone you wanted , as long as they came from ma bell . there .
they rented their phone . they didn ' t buy it .
one consequence of that was that the phone was never broken . and
these days are over .
we now have almost an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite one is the one in the middle - mp3 player , nose - hair and pink bru lighter .
and if you haven ' t seen this in your business so yet far , you can be sure you ' re going to be soon . and
and what it does is it gets people to go into business and ask that question .
now , you know what the answer to that question is ?
the answer is , " no . "
it ' s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn ' t do too much .
in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying objects , the same explosion of choice is .
health - it ' s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , we could do a , or we could do b . instead
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , " doctor , what should i do ? "
the doctor says a has these benefits and risks , and b has these benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , " if you were me , doctor , what would you do ? "
the doctor says , " but i ' m not you . "
the result is - we call it " patient autonomy . " that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , there is a shift in the burden of responsibility for making decisions from someone who knows something - namely the doctor - to someone who doesn ' t anything and is most likely to be sick and so therefore ' s not in the best constitution to make a decision - named the patient .
there ' s a huge marketing for prescription drugs for people like you and me that , if you think about it , doesn ' t make any sense at all , because we don ' t buy them .
why do they advertise around us if we can ' t buy ?
the answer is , you expect us to call the doctor the next morning and ask us for a change in the prescription .
now something as profound as our identity is a question of choice about what how this slide should show .
we don ' t inherit identity , we invent it . we
and we reinvent ourselves as often as we want . and
that means that every day when you wake up the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the standard assumption was that almost everybody had one , and that they married as quickly as they could , and then had children as they could .
the only real choice was " who , " not when , and not what they did after that .
today , everything is easy to .
i teach wonderful smart students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and ' not because they ' re less smart , not because they ' re less careful . and
it ' s because they ' re busy with other things , they ask themselves , " should i marry or not ? should i get married now ?
should i get married later ? should i first have children , or should i have career ? "
these are all engaging questions .
and you ' re going to answer these questions no whether that means doing all the tasks that i ' m going to give you and not a good grade in my class . and .
and in fact , you should do . these are important questions to answer to answer .
work - we are blessed , as carl illustrated , with the technology that allows us to work every minute from every day from every place on the planet - to the randolph hotel .
by the way , there ' s a corner that i ' m not going to tell you about anyone , where the wireless network works .
i ' m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is to have this incredible freedom of choice that we have make in terms of work , again and over again and again , whether we should work or not work . so
we can watch our kids play football , and we have our cell phone on one hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and probably our laptop probably on our lap . we
and even though they ' re all turned off , every minute we watch our child mutilating a football game , we ' also ask ourselves , " should i take that call ? and
should i answer that email ? should i write that letter ? "
and even though the answer to the question no , " it ' s certainly to be your experience of your kid ' s ball very different than it have been . and
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world that we lived in looked like this .
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not all a matter of choice .
and the world that we live in now looks like this .
and the question is , is that good news or bad news ?
the answer is " yes . "
we all know ' s good about it , so i ' m going to get about what s bad about it .
all of these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
one effect , paradoxical ways , is that it paralyzes instead of liberating it .
with so many options you can choose , it ' s very hard for people to even choose decide .
i ' m going to give you another dramatic example of this , a study of investmentvesti in voluntary pension .
a colleague of mine had access to investment records from vanguard , the giant fund of about a million employees and about 2 , 000 different jobs . a .
and what she found was per 10 investment fund that the employer offered dropped participation by two percent .
they offer 50 investment funds - 10 percent less employees join than if they only offered five . why ?
because it ' s 50 investment funds choose , it ' s so hard to decide which one to choose that they delayed it to tomorrow .
and then morning , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of , of course , never comes .
understand that ' t not only that people have to eat dog food when they go to retirement , because they don ' t have enough money to move , it also means that decisions are so hard that they miss large investments offers from their employers .
by not participating , they spend up to 5 , 000 dollars a year from the employer who would have been happy to raise their contribution .
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
you really want to make the decision right if it ' s for all eternity , right ?
they don ' t want to choose the wrong investment fund , or even the wrong salad fund .
so that ' s the one effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end less happy with the outcome of choice than if we had the opportunity to choose between fewer possibilities . so .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is caused by the large variety of different salad sauceses if you buy one , and it ' s not perfect - and , which salad sauce is already perfect ? it ' s easy to imagine that you could have made a different decision that have been better . and what happens is this visually leads you to regret the decision , and that regret negatively affects the happiness you had about you decision made , even if it was a good decision . and . alternative you made decision
the more possi there are , the easier it is nothing to regret at , that is s is disappointing for the choice they make .
second , what economists call excess cost of debt .
dan gilbert made a big point this morning by telling you how much the way we eva judge things depends on what we compare it .
well , if there are a lot of alternatives to think , it ' s easy to imagine attractive properties of alternatives you exclude , which makes you less happy with the alternatives you ' ve chosen .
here ' s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but here ' s what you should have thought .
here ' s a couple on the brooklyn .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . you have it all for yourself .
what could be better ? " damn , " the man thinks , " it ' s august .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is gone .
i could park right in front of my house . "
and he spends two weeks on the thought that he missed the opportunity to day after day to have a great parking lot .
individual costs reduce the happiness we get from our choices , even though what we ' ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more choice options there are for choice , the more attractive features of that choice are considered in the idol cost ofity .
here ' s another example .
now , this cartoon makes some statements .
he makes a statement about it in the now , and maybe slow about things .
but one important point he does is , whenever you choose to do one thing , you don ' t have to do other things .
and these other things may have a lot of attractive properties , and it ' s going to make what you ' re going to do less attractiveing .
third , escalating expectations .
this is what struck me when i wanted to change my jeans .
i ' m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time when there were only jeans of that kind , and they bought them , and they did bad , they were incredibly uncomfortable , and if they worn them long enough and often washed enough , they started feeling " ok . "
so i went to buy new jeans after many years of wearing the old jeans , and i said , " i ' d like have some jeans , here ' s my big one . " so
and the salesman said , " do you want thin , slightly attractive or wideness ?
do you want buttons or zip caps ? stone rock or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
you want to cut down far down , fliply , blah blah , blah . " and so on he said .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered , i said , " i ' d like the way that used to be the only way . "
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying testing all these damn jeans , and left the business - and i ' ll tell the truth - with the best appropriate jeans i ever had .
i had better . all this choice allowed me to do better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it to myself .
the reason i felt worse , with all these possibilities , my expectations for what made a good pair jeans , went up .
i had very low expectations . i didn ' t have concrete expectations than they were only existed in one way .
when they came to 100 species , damn , one of them should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn ' t perfect .
and so i compared what i got to what i expected , and what i had was disappointing compared to what i expected .
adding opportunities into people ' s lives inevitably increases the expectations that people have about how good these possibilities will be .
and that leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this , because if you were it , you would didnn ' t know about what this is was all about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that once everything to everything was better than everything was worse , than everything was worse , it was possible for people to experience experiences that were a pleasant surprise . the .
today , in the world that we live in - we wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as an expectation - the best thing you can ever hope is that things are as good as you expect them .
they ' re neverly surprised because their expectations , my expectations , are priseus .
the secret to happiness - that ' s what you ' ve all come to from - the secret to happiness is low expectations .
i want to say - a short autobiographical moment - that i ' m married to a woman , and she ' s really wonderful . i
i couldn ' t have done it better . i couldn ' t leave myself down .
but lay down is not always such a bad thing .
finally , a one consequence of buying a bad - sitting jeans if there ' s just one way to buy is that if you ' re unhappy , and you ' re wondering why who ' s in charge , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what could you have done ?
when hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and you buy one that ' s disappointing , and you ask why , who ' s in responsible charge ?
isn it as clear that the answer to the question is : you .
they could have done it better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the window , there ' s no excuse for mistakes .
and so when people make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about it , they accuse themselves .
clinical depressionploded in the industrial world over the last generation .
i think a significant - not the only , but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experienced that are disappointing because their standards are so high , and then , if you have to explain those experiences , they think it ' s their fault .
and so the balance result is that we ' re doing better , objectively , and we feel worse .
so let me remembernd you .
this is the official dogma , one that we all think is right is completely wrong . it ' s not true . this .
there ' s no question that some choice is better than no , but it doesn ' t follow that more choice is better than something choice . there
there ' s a magical amount . i don ' t know what it is . there .
i ' m pretty sure we ' ve missed that point long time onosing improvinging our public good .
now , as a rule question - i ' m almost done - as a principle of question , the thing think about , what allows all of this choices in the industrialized societies is material wealth . now
there are lot of places in the world , and we ' ve heard about a lot of them whose problem is not too big choice . there
their problem is they have too little .
so the things i ' m talking about are a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what ' s so frustrating and so annoying is : steve levitt told you yesterday about how these more expensive and hard - to install car seats don ' t help . it ' s a waste of money . and .
what i ' m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions - it ' s not easy that they don ' t help .
they even hurt .
they make we get worse .
if something of what allows the people of our society to make decisions to the societies where people have gained too little choices , would not only improve people ' s lives , but our would also be improve . if
economists call this a competitive improvement application .
income distribution will make everybody do better - not just the poor - because all this big choice iss us .
finally , please read this cartoon , and a developed person , says , " ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don ' t know anything possible in this goldfish tube . "
impished imagination , a short - sighted view of the world - and that ' s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came that the fish knows something .
because the truth is that if you break the goldfish glass so that everything is possible , you don ' have no freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the goldfish glass so that everything is possible , reduce happiness .
they increase paralysis and reduce happiness .
everybody needs a goldfish glass .
this is almost limited with absolute securityty - maybe for the fish , definitely for us .
but gettingying up off a metaphorical goldfish glass is a recipe for misery , and , i guess , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i ' ve been talked about some of these projects earlier before , the human genome and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we ' re starting from a new point : we ' ve digitized biology , and now we ' re trying to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by designing and building new life . in
we ' ve always tried to ask important questions .
what is life ? it ' s something i think many biologists have tried to understand and at different levels .
we ' ve tried different approaches to simplify it down to the smallest components .
we ' ve digitized over 20 years when we sequenced the human genome , the transition moved from the analog world of biology to the digital world of computers came .
now we ' re trying to ask , can we regenerate life , or can we create new life out of this digital universe ?
this is the a map of a small organism , mycoplasma materia , that has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we ' ve tried to we can do that with a even smaller genome .
we ' ve managed to avoid about a hundred genes from the 500 or so that are here .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple compared to ours . trust me , that ' s simple , but if we look at all these genes that we can eliminate one after another , it ' s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that the only way forward is actuallythesize this chromosome , which allows us to vary the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we synthesize a chromosome ?
is chemistry to make these really large molecules that has never been made before ?
and , if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome , by the way is just a piece of inert chemical material .
our steps in digitizing life were been exponential . our
our ability to write genetic code has evolved very slowly , but still increased , and our last point would now put on an exponential curve .
we started this 15 years ago .
it actually took a few years starting with a bioethicalsic review before we did the first experiments .
it turns out dna syntheticization is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make small pieces of dna 30 to 50 letters long , but it ' s a degeneral process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to develop a new method where we could to put these little pieces together and correct the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it ' s a little virus that kills bacteria .
we made little pieces , we made a error correction , and we had a dna molecule of about 5 , 000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it into a bacterium , and the bacterium started reading the genetic code and made viral particles . the
the viral particles were then released from the cells and came back and killed e . coli .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said they were exactly this model .
they laughed more than they do here .
so we think this is a situation where software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go a lot further . we wanted to build an entire bacterial chromosome - it has more than 58 , 000 , 000 letters of genetic code , so we thought , we build it in cassettes the size of the virus , where we could change the size of the cassette to understand what the individual components of a living cell .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be error free .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the error rate was in one error per 10 , 000 base pair .
we found 30 mistakes in sequenceing . if we used the original sequence , it would never been possible to go up .
part of the design is to make pieces that are 50 letters long , that have tolap with other 50 - letter pieces to build smaller sub - units to so they fit together .
we put unique elements in here .
you may have heard that we built watermark signs in it there .
think about it : we have a four - letter code : a , c , g and t .
triplets of these letters - these letters en codecode about 20 amino acids , and here ' s a single prediction for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
at first , we just signed .
some people were disappointed that it wasn was not poetry .
we made the pieces so we could just break them down with enzymes . there are enzymes that repair them and assesemblemble them .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that had five to seven thousand letters , putting them together to 24 , 000 - letters of pieces to putmble them back together , up to 72 , 000 pieces . and .
in each step , we made these pieces in excess so we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process , what they ' ll see in a minute .
we ' ve tried to get to the point of automation .
so , this looks like a basketball play .
when we get to these really big pieces - with over 100 , 000 base pairs - they won ' t just grow in e . coli . it ' ex beyond all thesi of modern molecular biology , and so we turned to other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism called homologous recombination that biology uses to repair dna that can break those pieces together .
here ' s an example of this . there ' s a organism called myocococcus that survives three million rads of radiation .
you can see in the upper field that his chromosome just breaks apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything assembled back the way it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely dry , they can even live in vacuum .
i ' m absolutely sure that life can exist in and move in space looking for aquatic conditions . i .
in fact , nasa has shown that there ' s a lot of this out there .
here ' s a diagram of the molecule that we made by using these processes - in fact , we only used yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces put them in . yefe automatically puts them together .
this is not a electron microscope photo ; it ' s a regular microscope shot .
it ' s such a big molecule that we can actually see it with the light microscope .
these are photographs over six seconds .
this is the publication we just recently finished .
that ' s over 58 , 000 letters of genetic code - it ' s the largest molecule with defined structure ever created by humans .
it has a molecular field of over 300 million .
if we put it with a size of 10 stroke and without a distance , it would cover 142 pages just to express that genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
itly obvious is it ' s very simple with a virus ; it ' s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
it ' s just as easier if you do it in eukaryots as we are : you just take out the nucleus and you put another one in , and that ' s exactly what you ' ve all heard about cloning . it . it .
in archae bacterias , the chromosome is embedded into the cell , but just recently we ' ve shown that you can do a complete transplant of one chromosome from one cell to another and activate it .
we cleaned the chromosome of a microbial species . roughly speaking , these two are as far from each other as humans and mice . we gave some extra genes so we could choose that chromosome . we decoraded it with enzymes to destroy all the proteins . and it was very amazing when we put it in into a cell - and you ' ll estimate our very sophisticated graphs here . two are re estimate each are we eachs .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought this was the end here , but we tried to get the it a little further . in
that ' s the main mechanism of evolution here .
we find all the kinds of species here that have captured a second chromosome , or a third chromosome from somewhere , each adding thousands of characteristics in just a second to a species in a .
so people who think of evolution as a gene that is changed at a point has missed a lot from biology .
there are enzymes called restriction enzymes that actually digest dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell has none ; the chromosomes that we ' ve put have .
it was exsipatd in the cell , and realized that the other chromosome as alien material digesting , and so we ended up with just one cell with a new chromosome .
it turned blue because of the genes we put .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species and converted them completely into a new species based on the new software that we put into the cell . and
all the proteins changed , the membranes changed - when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we transferred .
it may sound like genomic almia , but by moving the software dna , we can change things quite dramatically .
now i ' ve argued that this is not the genesis - this is based on 3 . 5 billion years of evolution . now
and i ' ve argued that maybe we ' may be about creating a new form of cambrian explosion in which there might be massive new species based on this digital design . and
why should we do that ?
i think it ' s pretty obvious about what we need .
we ' ve grown growing from six and a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet are for anyone who existed in 1946 ; within 40 years it will be four .
we have problems with food , fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6 . 5 billion people .
it ' s going to be a challenge to offer this for nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , 30 plus billion barrels of oil . that ' s a hundred million barrels a day . we
when we think about biological processes , or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there ' s all the co2 of this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
we have , from our discoveries around the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future . we .
the electronics industry had a dozen components , and look at the diversity that came out of it .
we ' re primarily hitting the limits of biological reality and the limits of our imagination .
we now have technologies because of these rapid synthetic methods to do what we call combinatorial genetics .
we have the ability to build a big robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine making these 20 million different genes or optimizing these processes to make octane or making drugs new vaccines , we can change with a very small team more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science . if .
and it ' s just selection . we can select by quality , production of chemicals or fuel production or vaccine production and so on .
this is a picture of real design software that we ' re working on that you can actually sit on and design new species on the computer . this .
you know , we don ' t necessarily know what it s going to look like . ; we know exactly what their genetic code is going to look like .
we ' re now focusing on fourth - generation fuel .
you recently saw corn to ethanol , which is just a bad experiment .
we have second and third generations are going to come out relatively pretty soon that will have much higher sugar values , like octane or different kinds of butanol .
but , as we think , the only way of biology has have a huge impact without further increasing the cost of food or limitaring on its availability is when we see co2 as a source , and therefore we ' re working on cells that go this way .
and we think that we re going to be the first have fourth - generation fuels in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a way .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different ways .
this is a organism that we described in 1996 .
it lives in the deep sea , about a mile and a half miles deep , at almost boiling water temperatures .
it converts co2 into methane under the use of hydrogen as a source of energy .
we study see if we can use stored co2 that could just be brought to production plants , convert the co2 into fuel to drive this process . we
within a short period of time , we believe that we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life . within .
you know , we really have - moderate goals like replacing the whole petrochemical industry . right . if you couldn ' t do that at ted , where else ? to become a major source of energy .
but in the same , we ' re working on apply the same approaches to developing vaccines .
you saw it with flu this year , and we ' re always a year back the back , and we have a dollar too little when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by creating recombinant vaccines in the advance .
that ' s what the future might look like with changes , the evolutionary tree can be accelerated today with synthetic bacteria , archaea , and perhaps eukaryots . that
we are light years from improving people , and our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to perhaps do that . thank you . we
at the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to tell you how the machine works .
so now it ' s there . and for those of you who wasn ' t there at the time , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted - 27 kilometers diameter . so
his job is to create the conditions that existed less than a billionth of a second after the beginning of the universe - up to 600 million times in a second .
it ' s just incredibly ambitious .
this is the machine below geneva .
we take pictures of this mini - big bang in detectors .
this is what i ' m working on this . it ' s called the atlas detector - 44 meters in width , 22 meters in diameter .
here ' s a spectacular picture of the atlas in construction , so you can see the scales .
on september 10 last year , the machine launched .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it caused an hugermous noiseing in the control room .
it ' s a picture of the first ray particle that went all the way around the lhc , and then deliberately colliding with a part of the lhc to make a rain of particles on the detector . it . it
in other words , when we saw this picture on september 10 , we knew the machine worked , which is a great victory .
i don ' t know if this created the biggest explosion , or this , when someone went to the google page and found the front page like this .
it means that we have a cultural impact alongside the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires here - these golden wires here . about .
these wires conduct 13 thousand lights when the machine ' s at high - performance .
now , the engineers amongst you will look at you and say , " no , you don ' t . these are little wires . "
they can do that because if you cool them very far , they become what they call superconductors .
so at minus 271 degrees , colder than the space between the stars , these wires can handle the tension .
in one of the connections , between over nine thousand magnets at the lhc , there was a manufacturing incident .
so the wires heating up a small bit , and 13 to thousand amp suddenly encounter electrical resistance .
that was the result .
now , this is even more amazing when you can imagine that the magnets weigh over 20 tons and move by about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we did .
we re conditioned them , repaired them .
now they ' re all back on their way back now .
by the end of march , the lhc will be functional again .
we ' re going to turn it on , and expect be able to collect the first data in june or july , and continue our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are . we .
now , of course , in a way , such accidents again spark the debate about the value of science and engineering at those limits . it ' s easy to reject that .
i think the fact that it ' s so hard , the fact that we reach beyond our limits is the value of things like the lhc .
i ' m going to leave my final words to an english scientist : humphrey davey , who , i suspect when he defended the useless experiments of his apprent , his apprentice was michael faraday said this : " nothing is so dangerous to the development of the human mind than to assume that our scientific ideas are final , that there are no mysteries in nature , that our triumphs are full , and that there are no new worlds to conquer . " . " i he " i are and that there are no new
thank you .
i ' m a writer .
writing books is my profession , but of course it ' s more than that .
it ' s also my great lifelong love and fascination .
and i don ' t expect that to ever change .
but , something weird has happened in my life and my career that led me completely rethink my connection to this work . but
this strange event was that i recently wrote a book - a biography called - eat , pray , love - that , decided different from all of my previous books , for some reason , went out into the world and became a big mega - event , international best selling thing . this . this . this
the result is that no matter where i come , i am treated as if i ' m dedicating to executionse .
seriously - fall !
for example , you come very woed to me and say , " don ' t you afraid you ' never going to beyondpass that success ?
do ' t you be afraid writing on your whole life and never create a book that anybody in the world care about ? never again ?
okay , that really courage .
but it would be worse if i didn ' t remember that over 20 years ago , when i first told that i wanted to be a writer , i ve been faced with the same kind of fear response . but
people said , - , - are you not afraid to never succeed ?
do ' t you be afraid the humiliation of a rejection kills you ?
do you afraid that you go do this for your life and never come to it , and you ' re going to die on a ru pile of frozend dreams - your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure ?
that like that , you know .
the answer - the short answer to all of these questions is : - yes .
yeah , i ' m afraid of all these things .
and i ' ve always had them .
and i ' m afraid of even more things that no one would think . and
like algae - and other frightening things .
but when it comes to writing , i ' ve thinking about it recently and wondering , why ? but
is that rational ?
is it logical that somebody should be expected to be afraid to do the work that they feel dedicated to ?
and what ' s about the creative enterprises that they make us insecure about the mutual state of mind - in a way that other professions don ' t ?
my father , for example , was a chemist , and i can ' t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist when he was asked if he was afraid to be a chemist . my
with your chemist blockage , john - how are you with that ?
it just didn ' t happen , you know ?
but to be fair - the group of chemists have not over the centuries not gotten the reputation of alcoholic manic - depressed people over centuries . but
but we writers seem to have this kind of reputation , but not just the writers , but the creatives of all genres , seem to have this reputation of being mentally incredibly unstable . but
all you have to do is look at the bitterim death records of really great minds 20th century who died young and often died on their own hand .
and even those who didn ' t actually have suicide seemed to be been neglected by their talents by their .
norman mailer said just before he died in his last interview : - each of my books killed me a little bit further .
an extraordinary statement you can make about your life work .
but we don ' t even shze when we hear someone say something like this , because we ' ve known these kinds of statements for so long , and somehow we ' ve adopted the notion and collectively accepted that creativity and suffering somehow belong related , and that art , - at the end , - always leads to the soul .
the question i want to ask everyone here today is : is this idea perfect fine for you ?
do you feel comfortable with it ? because at just a centimeter away - i ' m not comfortable with that idea at all .
i think it ' s disgusting .
and i think it ' s dangerous , and i don ' t want to watch it s taken adopted into the next century . and
i think it ' s better if we encourage our great creatives to live .
and i definitely know that for me - in my situation - , it would very dangerous me to start of tining down this dark path of guulation kind of - especially in the situation that i ' m in my career .
that means - look , i ' m pretty young . i ' m only about 40 years old . that
i may have another 40 years of work in me .
and it ' s very likely that everything i ' m going to write from now on is rated by the world as the work that came after the failed success of my last book , right ? and
i say it straightly , because we ' re all kind of friends like here - it ' s extremely likely that my greatest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts that can get someone to start at 9 o ' m in the morning drinking gin . and i don ' t want that .
i ' d rather continue doing this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after a while of reflection , it seems to me that in order to continue writing , i have to create a kind of protective psychological construct .
somehow , from now on i have find a way to write a safe distance between me and my very natural disagresion about how what the reaction response to the writing will be .
while i ' ve been looking for models the last year to do that , i ' ve also been looking in the past , and i ' ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have better or more rationalable ideas about it than we do , how to help creative creats deal with the emotional risks associated with creativity . i year to while i been to while
this quest led me to ancient greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
but in ancient greece and rome , people didn ' t believe that creativity comes from people , ok ? but
they believed that creativity was a kind of divine servant spirit coming from a distant , unknown source people - for an unseen , unknown reasons .
the greeks called these divine servants spirits of creativity - demons .
socrates known by socrates that he believed it that he had a demon who telling him his wisdom from a distance .
the romans had the same idea , called this kind of bodyless creative mind - genius .
that ' s great . the romans didn ' t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical divine creature believed that literally live in the walls of an artist ' s - sort of like dobby , the houself - would assist out and assist the artist kind of invisiblely the and create the result of the work .
this is brilliant - there it is , there ' s the distance i talked about - the psychological construct that protects you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew it worked that way , right ?
the artist of age was protected from certain things , like , for , too much narcissism , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn ' t spend everything for yourself . everybody knew you had this bodyless genius that helped you .
when your work worked - not entirely your fault , right ?
everybody knew your genius was a little paralyzed .
so the people in the west really thought about creativity for a long time .
and then the renaissance came , and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let ' s put the human individual at the center of the universe - about all the gods and mysteries - and there ' s no room for mystical creatures who adopt commands of divinity .
it ' s the beginning of rational humanism , and people started to believe that creativity came completely from their own individual .
for the first time in history , people call this artist or artist a genius - rather than having a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think allowing a person to thinks he or she is like the vessel , like the bastavis and the essence and the source of all divine , creative , unknown , infinite mystery is a little too much responsibility to break them up of a fragile human psyche . you up a
it ' s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
this disfigurcts and distortes whole egos , and it creates all these unmaginable expectations of success .
i think that this success pressure has killed our artists for the last 500 years .
and if that ' s true - and i think it ' s true - is the question is .
can we change it ?
maybe back to an ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and the mystery of the creative .
maybe not . maybe
maybe we can ' t just wipete the thinking of 500 years of rational humanism in an 18 - minute talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience who would make really legitimate scientific doubts about the idea of - basically fairies , people and apply fee cards to their projects and so on .
i ' m probably not be able to take all of you on this journey . i
but the question i want to ask is , why not ?
why not think about it that way ? why
because it makes just as much sense as anything i ' ve heard about when it comes to explaining the absolutely crazy moodness of the creative process .
a process that - like anyone who ' s ever tried to do something - so in other words , actually everybody here - doesn t always acts reasonable . a
in fact , sometimes he can feel really paranormal .
i had such an encounter recently when i met the extraordinary american poet eleanor stone , who ' is now over 90 , but who ' has been a poet throughout her life . she told me that she was working when she growing out in village virginia on the fields , and she said she could feel and hear a poem coming about the landscape would come to her . i feel and i
she said it would be like a thunderous train of air .
he would washing over the country over them .
she felt when it came , because it was going to make the earth under her feet .
she knew that , she could only do one thing that , and that was - in her words - running like the devil .
she ran the devil to the house like while she was pursued by this poem , and it was all that she had to get fast enough to a piece of paper and a pencil so that she could if it was going through her , she and hold it on the leaf .
in other paintings , she wasn ' t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn ' t reach the house , and the poem was roll through her and she missed it . she said it would keep move over land and , as she said , look for another poet .
and then there were these those moments - i ' ll never forget the part - she said that there were moments when she almost missed it . and
so , she runs to the house looks for the paper , and the poem goes through her , and she grabs a pencil just as it goes through her , and then - she said - it was like reaching her other hand for it and getting it . so
she caught the poem on his tail and pulled it back into her body and took it onto the sheet of paper . she
at these opportunities , the poem came literallyly and intact on paper - but backwards - from the last word to the first .
when i heard that , i thought - this is creepy - that ' s exactly how my creative process happens .
it ' s not like my creative process - i ' m not the channel !
i ' m a molebird . in order to work , i have to get up at the same time and sweat every day , stretch myself and really breath through really uncomfortable .
but even in my mut belt , i sometimes stretched this thing . but .
and i guess many of you have done that as too .
even i had work or ideas that came from a source through me that i can ' t identify .
what is this thing ?
and how do we relate it without losing our minds about it , but in fact , even us in mental health ? and
for me , the best living example of how to do this is the musician tom waits . i got to him for a magazine a few years ago .
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of his life , tom was the embodiment of the torturemented modern artist who was trying to masterte these uncontrollable creative impulses that lived in him and to deal with them .
but then he got older and quieter . he told me that one day he was driving on a highway in los angeles , and everything changed for him . but
he drove at high speed when he suddenly hears a little fragment of a melody that , as ' often in inspiration is , is agonizingly difficult to gras for him , and he wants it . it ' s glorioous . he crawaps after it , but he can ' t reach it .
he doesn ' t have a piece of paper , he doesn ' t have a pencil , he doesn ' t have a cassette tape recorder . he
so he starts to rise this old anty in him , like - i ' m going to lose this thing , and i ' m going be pursued by this song forever . so
i ' m not good enough ; i can ' t do it .
but instead of getting panicked , he just stopped .
he ended the whole process of thinking and did something completely new .
he just looked in the sky and said , " sorry , can ' t you see i ' m driving car ? "
do i look like i could just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a cheaper moment if i can take care of you .
if not ' , somebody else sorry killing today .
go and guurn leonard cohen .
his whole working process work has changed after that .
not the work itself . it was continued to often as dark as ever .
but the process and the severe revetion sur around him was suspended when he took the genius out of , where he didn ' t cause anything but trouble and left him back where he sort of came from , and he realized that it didn ' t have to be an internalized , agonizing thing . but
there could be a strange , wondrous , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the alien external thing that wasn ' t just tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a little bit the way i worked , and it has saved me before .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the writing process of - eat , pray , love - and i fell into one of these mines of doubt that we all fall when we work on something and it doesn ' t work . you start to think it ' s going to be a disaster . this is going to the worst book ever written . this the this is was - the
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just put the project in .
but then i remembered tom had talk talking into the sky , and i tried .
so i took my look of the manuscript , and i spoke my comment towards a empty corner of the room .
i said loudly , - listen , you thing , you and i both know , if this book isn ' t brilliant , it ' s not entirely my fault , right ?
because you can see that i invest everything i have . i don ' t have more than that .
so if you want to have it better , you have to stop up here and keep your share of agreement .
okay . but if you don ' t do - you know what , then the hell with it .
i ' m going to keep writing anyway , because that ' s my job . i
and i want to paraphrase that i was here today for my part of the job .
because , at the end , it ' s the following : centuries ago , people in the desert of north africa , people gathered into moon ceremonies with sacred dances and music that were held for hours - until the morning . because
these dances were always great , because the dancers were professional , and they were fantastic .
but every now in a while , very rarely , something special happened : one of the actors actually became transcendent .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know that all of all have seen such an performance in your life . and
it was like time stopped and the dancer was jumping through a kind of gate . he did nothing different than he ' d ever done before - 1 , 000 nights earlier - but everything it came together .
and all of a sudden , he no longer seemed pure human .
he was litnated from the inside and lit from the bottom , and everything lit through a divine fire .
when this happened at the then time then , people knew what that was . they called it by his name .
they put their hands together , and they started singing : allah , allah , allah , god , god , god .
this is god , you know ?
interesting historical footnote : when the carrot conquered southern spain conquered , they brought with this practice , the expression changed over the centuries of - allah , allah , allah - to - ole , ole , ole , ole - which you still hear in sword and flamenco dances .
if a actor in spain has did something impossible , something magical : - allah , ole , ole , allah , allah , great , bravo - incredible , it is : a fleeting look at god . if . if
and that ' s great because we need that .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning when the dancer himself wakes up and realizes that it ' s 11 o ' clock on a tuesday - and he no longer carries a spark of god in him . but
he ' s just an aging mortal with pain knees , and maybe he ' s never going to go back to those heights again .
and maybe never anyone will god ' s name again when he turns , but what should he do with the rest of his life ?
that ' s hard . that .
this is one of the most painful corrections of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn ' t have to be as much embarras if you didn ' t believe in the beginning that the most extraordinary aspects of their existence came from them .
if you may just believe that you ' re a loan - from an unimaginable source of an reading time of your life that ' s passed on to somebody else once you ' re done doing it .
when we start thinking about it that way , it changes everything changes .
so i ' ve started thinking , and so i think certainly in the last few months , while i ' m working on the book that ' s about to come - as the dangerous , scary , highly expected successor of my past success . so
what i have to say myself the when i get crazy about it is , don ' t be afraid . what
don ' t be daunted .
just do your job .
keep to be there for your contribution , whatever it may be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
when the stupid divine genius that you ' re put decides show a bit of wonder through your effort for a moment , then - oh ! when
and if you don ' not , still dance your dance .
and - oil ! - for you despite all .
i believe it , and i feel like we should teach that .
ole ! - for you despite all this , just for that having the mere human love and the kind to be there .
thank you . thank
thank you . thank
ole !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice caps , which had about three the size of the bottom 48 states years , has declined by 40 percent .
but this doesn ' t strong enough express the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn ' t show the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic ice caps is the beating heart of our global climate system .
it grows in the winter and shrinks in summer .
the next slide i ' m going to show you is a time - lapse photograph that ' s happened over the last 25 years .
the permanent ice is marked in red .
as you can see , it grows on the dark blue . this is the annual ice in winter , and it shrinkinks in summer .
what ' s called permanent ice , five years old or older , is almost like blood flowing out of the body here . what
in 25 years , it will be gone from here to here .
this is a problem because warming shows the frozen reason around the arctic ocean , where there are s huge amounts of frozen carbon , which , when it comes up , is converted from microbes to methane . this
compared to the total amount of climate - change substances in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross that critical point .
already today , in some flat lakes in alaska , methane burns itself out of the water itself .
professor katey walter at the university in alaska traveled another team to another flat lake last winter .
wow !
you ' re fine . the question is , how will we going take us ?
and one reason is that this enormous reservoir is heating greenland from the north .
this is a year waterwater current .
but the volumes are much larger than ever before .
this is the kangaroo river in southern greenland .
if you want to know how sea level rises through landing , here , it flows into the sea .
these rivers are increasing rapidly .
at the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest ice mass on the planet .
last month , researchers reported that the entire continent now has a negative ice sheet .
and the west atlantic , which appeared over a few underwater islands , is particularly strong in melting .
that ' s 20 feet of sea level , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the third largest ice mass , you see new lakes up top that were a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water out from that melting water .
in the alaska , this glacier is the drinking water source for this city .
the amount of water have expanded .
but when they finishse , most of the drinking water will go away as well .
in california , a 40 percent reduction in the snow sierra leone .
this is about the storages .
and the predictions how you read them are serious .
this dry all over the world leads to a dramatic increase in fire .
and the disasters all around the world have increased in a really extraordinary and unprecedented scale .
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 .
this is a completely unsustainable pattern of development .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it does .
in the last five years , we ' ve produced 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours - 25 million tons every day into the oceans .
look closely at the area of the eastern pacific , from the american continent north and both sides of the indian subcontinent , where there ' s a dramatic decline in oxygen in the oceans .
the biggest single factor for global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the biggest problem at .
the united states is one of the two largest pollrants , along with china .
and the proposal was to build many more coal mines .
but we ' starting to see a change .
here are the ones that have been eliminated in the last few years with some green alternatives that have been proposed .
however despite , there ' s a political debate in our country .
and the coal industries and the oil industries have spent a quarter a billion dollars last year promoting clean coal , which is inherent , a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something .
around christmas , at me home in tennessee , ran out a billion tons of carbonxide ran .
you probably to see it in the news .
this is the second largest waste in america country .
this happened around christmas .
one of thes of the coal industry around christmas was this .
frosty the coalman is a happy , happy guy .
it ' s in thin and abundance in america , and it ' s helps to grow our economy .
frosty , the coal man gets cleaner every day .
it ' s affordable and loving , and workers remain in pay and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful miners is the head of massey coal .
let me say one very clear : al gore , nancy pelosi , harry reid , they don ' t know what they ' re talking about .
so the alliance for climate change alliance has launched two campaigns .
this is one , part of it .
at the coalerge , we see climate change as a serious threat to our business .
so we set it down on the top line to spend a substantial amount of money to get an ad to get the truth about coal . so
in fact , coal is ' not dirty .
we think it ' s clean - and it smells good .
so , don ' t worry about climate change .
just leave that to us .
acid coal , you ' ve heard a lot of it .
so let ' s take a tour of this modern , clean carbon fiber . so
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it ' s the sound of clean coal technology .
and yet burning coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , the remarkably clean coal technology that you see here changes everything .
look at it closely , this is the clean carbon technology today .
finally , the positive alternative merges with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that connects these all is our dependence on carbon - based fuels like dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there ' s a bold new solution to get us out of this miserable situation .
service supply america with 100 percent clean electricity in the next 10 years .
a plan to bring america back to work , to make us safer and to help stop global warming .
finally , a solution big enough to solve our problems .
re service america . find out more .
this is the last one .
it ' s about a revization of america .
one of the fastest ways to reduce our dependence on old , dirty fuels that drokee our world .
the future is here . wind , the sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create well - paid jobs .
re service america . it ' s time to accept reality .
there ' s an old african proverb : " if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to get far , go together . "
we need to get far , quickly .
thank you . thank
i want to start by asking you to think about the time of your childhood when they were playing with building blocks .
while they realized how to reach out and access hands , pick the tilot and move the hands , they actually learned to think and solve problems by understanding and changing spatial context .
spatial thinking is closely related to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist - inspired by the way we interact with real objects - along with my collaborator patti and my colleague jeevan kalaithi , i began to wonder : what if we use computers , instead of a mouse - pointer that moves like a digital fingertip on a flat surface . what if we could intervene with both hands and physically grab data and order it as we want ? as and grab data
this question was so exing that we decided to explore the answer and developed sibles .
in short , a sible is an interactive computer the size of a cookie .
they can be moved with your hand , they can sense each other , they can track their movements , and they can have a screen and a radio receiver . they
more importantly , they ' re physical , because why you can only move them through extending your hands and access like building blocks .
and the sibles are an example of a new generation of tools for manipulapulation digital data .
and as these tools become more physical and gain a sense of their movements , recognize each other and perceize the subtleties of our interaction with them , then we can start exploring new and entertaining types of interactions .
i ' ll start with a few simple examples .
this sible is designeded for the video user , and when i flip it in one direction , the video is played forward ; when i flip it in the other direction , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits sense each other .
so when i put them side - by - side , that will makes you interest .
when you ' re surrounded by a , you can notice that and you can get a little nervous .
and they also feel their movement and their slopet .
one interesting consequence of the interactions that we began to see was that we could apply everyday gestures to data , such like as wash color the way you do it with liquids .
in this case , weed three sins as a potator , and i can use them to pour paint in the ones in the middle , where they mixed up .
if we overdose it , we can throw back a little bit .
there ' are also some nice opportunities in education like languages , math , logic games , where we give people the ability to rapid try and want to see the results immediately . there .
here i am - this is a fibonacci series that i make with a simple equation program .
this is a game with words that ' s a kind of a mixture of scrabble and bogle . this
basically , every round you have randomly assigned letter to each , and while you ' re trying to make words , they ' re tested by a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , you re mixedd again , and you have a new combination of letters and new possibilities to try .
thank you . thank
these are some kids who came on a trip to the media lab , and i could get them to try it and took a video of it .
they really loved it .
one interesting thing about these kinds of applications is that you don ' t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is " make words , " and they you know exactly what to do .
here are a couple of people testing it .
this is our latest beta tester down the bottom right there .
it turned out he just wanted to stack up the soda .
so for him , they were just construction blocks .
this is an interactive animated film application .
we wanted to develop a learning for language learners .
this is anthony . this .
he can bring new characters into the scene by lift up the sible from the table that shows this character . he .
here he let the sun .
the sun rises . the .
now he puts a tractor into the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by shake the salibles and putting them - by - side , he can let the characters interact .
. invent his own story .
hello !
it ' s a story with an open - ending , and he can decide how it evolves .
flying cat .
the last example that i have time to show today is a music sequencer for live performances that we ' ve recently developed act which sounds as sounds of how leaders , bass and drum act .
each one has four different variations ; you can choose which one want to use .
and you can put those notes into the sequence that you can then arran in any patterns .
and you fill them in by just putting a tone - decimable to a sequence - numerable .
there are effects that you can change live , such like as hall and filters .
you connect it to a particular sound and then you tend it to set down . you
and then major effects like speed and volume that you apply to the entire sequence .
so let ' s see .
we start by putting the leadership in into two sequence seriesbles and putting them in a row , extending them and adding a little bit more to the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i ' m going to do some another drum .
and now i connect the filter with the drum so that i can control the effect live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by flipping the speed one direction or another .
and now i still connect the filter to the bass for a bit more expression .
i can change the sequence as it happens .
so i don ' t have to plan them in advance ; i can improvise them ; extend them or shorten them during the while .
and finally , i can eliminate the whole sequence by bending the volume stemmeble to the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my excitement is to develop new human - computer interfaces that fit better with how our brains and bodies work . so
and today i had time to show you a part of this new design world and some of the possibilities of what that we ' re working on in our lab . and
the idea i ' d like to leave you with is that we are at the verge of this new generation of adverts for interacting with digital media that bring information into our world that follows matches our requirements . and
thank you . thank
i ' m looking forward to talking to all of you .
yes , good day .
i ' m happy i ' m there .
yeah , so , what should biohacking be ?
i have to get that with a little bit , which is that biohacking is just looking at about modern molecular biology .
i ' m studying molecular biology a , and i ' ve been looking biohacking for a years , and i started that because i just wanted to know more and i wanted to do it myself , which what i learned in theoretical . i
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to sort of get closer to matter , like that .
i think that molecular biology generally now , so generally speaking , biotechnology , everything you belong into it , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely is important , it ' is extremely important , and much , much more important in the future .
there are so controversial things like all these genetically engineered plants on the farm .
there ' s now craig venter in the u . states s states . trying to biofuel , which is gas from algae . there
then , there are things that have come totally in everyday life , which most people don ' t aware of most people , like detergent enzymes that allow us to wash at 40 degrees of laundry , are also genetically optimized enzymes .
and the list can keep on and going .
and so out of the interest in this in this technology , i just went further .
so what why to hack now ?
most people know most people know this from the software sector . most
computers hack , and then it always in the media , yes , the hackers break somewhere and steal data and so on .
now this is kind of very sad for the hacker scene , because this doesn ' t really affect what it actually started like and what ' s really behind it .
and that is that the software hackers started ' 70s , ' 80s with computer hackers in the ' 80s , and that ' s what also came the internet .
and it ' s about solving problem in a playful , creative , original way .
and problem , this is not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be just a access problem , which is simpliizing things , so any problem , raise a question , and how can you do that differently or how can you do better ? and . and
and it ' s just it ' s just to grew up with software , but there ' s also in the electronics , there ' s also a whole tin scene who ' s using electronics circuits doing all kinds of dirty things circuits .
and now goes towards biology , and i want to take this metaphor , which comes from synthetic biology , that biology is actually an information science , because , the d . n . a code is an abstract code , which is , yes , it ' s not quite the same as computers , because it ' s dynamic , because it ' s matter , which ' s real matter , not just cyber . i want to take this i to take
but it ' s also a code , and you can also program it , and thereforely you can hack it , like that , and that ' s what i find found that was incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to go a lot deeper into . but
this actually only taken two thousand eight really shape , these networks .
there ' s hackteria dot org , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with a collaboration based in india , but that now has members or active people all over the world . there
this has a more artistic dimension , so there are a lot of artists and philosophers , in working with scientists dealing with these technologies and asking questions and process this creatively , there are museum exhibitions , and yes , all sorts of things .
but it ' s really always about finding such a gentry access , such a playful interaction with it .
and then there ' s do - it - yourself - bio - dot org , d . i . y . bio .
this is a network from the u . s . , which is actually more a kind of a forum where you stay and discuss online .
they ' re a little bit more technical oriented , and they ' re a little bit more business the way , and there ' s also questions , yes , practical questions being asked .
and from these networks that have made this popular , there ' s a scene like this that i ' want to portrait for a second moment .
here in the image on the left you see biocurious , which is a hackerspace , which is basically a kind of school , a private school , a nonpro profit where anyone can come to .
kids , old people , all kindss of people go there to just deal with it , they ' ve set up a lab and they look see at what can you do if when these lab protocols work .
on the bottom left is a group in indonesia , the house of natural fibers , but they ' ve been around for quite a long time .
for long than these other two networks .
they ' re also dealing in such an artistic aspect with biological materials and , yes , electronics tapes , and they combine it in a pretty scarcious way .
a group from ankara that i met a while ago , who they have , this is a student group that wanted to convey the public more about what they ' re learning in college , and so they ' ve been doing street hard little actions and asked people to explain what d . n . a is . i
and i have a of the other picture a lecture up in copenhagen in copenhagen in the medical museum in combination with an exhibition on this . and .
and that is , yes , these are pretty young people all the time , but the only thing that actually really unites you all is this fascination with technology . and .
and what you do with it and also specifically towards society and ask , like , okay , what do you know , what do you want to participate in , do you have an interested in bringing with it this ? and ? and
so , oka , order to hack biology now , you need materials .
you need biological materials , course , and but you also need tools , and that ' s a laboratory .
or , what you normally understand by a lab is are kind of cheap machines , extremely expensive , extremely remotennected , only for professionals , trained academics with a ph . d . and so on . or .
and our approach was just to say , okay , actually you don ' t have to do that .
this ' s actually not necessary , because every coffee machine actually has highertica technology than most lab devices , that is s really what the case .
and s o with this premise with this premise was , for example , brian degger in england tried to assemble a minimal lab , then took a steam pressure cooker , a heat plate and , yes , soup , and then worked bacteria .
so anyone who ' s been eatn a soup that he ' ve been left too long has done it before .
i then tried that to expand a little bit in my lab , and then buying second - hand equipment on ebay and did a little of d . n . analysis , tried to do a fatherhood test , which so something n . fingerprinting at home .
now this shouldn ' t be a joke , but . down here in the picture you see the lab , in performance row , so there ' s a self garage with all kinds of laboratory gr that the university has done , a group in paris that has set up something set there and is pretty successful with it and also doing pretty interesting things , and i want to do a another project briefly .
and this is biocurious , the just hackerspace mentioned , this one , a kind of science basically for molecular biology .
and yes , well , you can see , it ' s relatively heterogen , so there ' s a holder from people doing it at home alone to large larger organizations that it more formal in institutionalized form . and . it and
but always the idea that it should be simple and accessible .
the first project that we did as an international group , when we became of aware of ourselves , oka , we ' re here now as a real scene , and we ' re online , and so we know the people who are always chatting and so on .
and then founders just came from the do - it - yourself bio org website came , and he said , okay , we really have need to meet now , meet real , and then organized two events , one in london , two , thousand 10 , and then after in the u . s . a . , in san francisco .
and then it was also all about , yeah , who are we , what do we want , what do we want , what do we want to share ? and
and what are our values , and what are what is our goal , our foundation ?
and then we worked a code - of conduct .
that was quite intuitive , so everybody just expressed their wishess , his and what keeps them then .
and there was , i think , a very good code came .
and then we have it ' s not obvious , but that ' s yes , i think , has prevailed pretty well , people are quite convinced of this .
and we even tried to bring that back to the academic world as well , but it didn ' t of t happen .
so i think we from the biohacker scene are actually one step far further than the academic world .
yeah , what kind of projects are we actually do now ?
one project that i did with the hackteria network in switzerland itself was that we wanted to create what ' s called optical trap or optical paintples .
this is when if you focus a laser beam , on you in the space , then you can capture little particles in the air or in the liquid and then in that focus , so , that ' s captured there , so like a tractor beam basically . this
it this really works , this ' s done in the academic setting , and we thought , well , we might get that , then we took a webcam thatrewing up , switched off the lens , turn around , then you have a microscope that ' s about four hundred times .
this is what you see down there .
and then we screwed a d . v . d . flamer and pulled the flame out laser out and then tried to focus on this camera there .
and unfortunately that didn ' t work , but we ' ve learned a lot about it .
another project that which from the french group in paris , which has worked , which is pretty cool .
and that is that he has such a well know , a brainwave sensor device , like e . e . g . or something like that , so he ' s been looking at neurobiology , his name is sam neurohack . that
he then he built this helmet there , and in cooperation with the museum , that went .
and then the visitors could go into the room , sit on this chair , sit on this helmet .
then your brainwaves were measured , and depending on what you thought or how you thought , different lights were went in the room .
it was a pretty fancy project .
another thing from the united states that has to do with this father ' s class , is the p . c . r , which is polymer chain reaction , complicated word .
so it ' s about just copying genes , transing genes , that replicaing fragments so you can make them visible .
so if i do this that what the profilers are at the scene , then go , collect any hair samples it , and then they do these turnss , they do this method , and then you can say , okay , this hair belongs to this person , like this .
and the machines that do like this , they ' re pretty expensive that you buy commercially , the cheapest ones will go off at four thousand dollars .
and this isn ' s not in the hobby , but it ' s a really cool technology that can also do a lot . and
so this is just one application of a lot things you can do with this .
and they ve got two builders and said , well , we ' s make this easierr and cheaper , and then we out of open source , so free hardware , electronics , they ' ve this device , and they actually brought this to market , and are now the cheapest manufacturer of these devices in the world . world . and they and , they and
i think six hundred dollars or something like that .
but anyway , ' it ' s still not cheap , but it ' s definit certainly in a context where it ' s becoming much more available .
so i think it ' s a very successful hack .
one project that i recently started was to build a gene gun .
gene gun , yes , like a kind air pressure gun , that shoots about this far , two centimeters or something .
you put d . n . a on gold particles , and then the gold particles into this air pressure gun , and then i shot them on onions , and then i made them glow like this .
so the device you see that didn ' t work .
but this is my prototype , but which looked pretty brutal , on a branch like this , put the thing on it , put electronics on it and pressure , and but that was the pressure was too high , the thing broken . but
and then i took a pick donor and i plugged it to it .
a vision plater , if you make it full of water , it has enough pressure , so i think , like 40 to 60 - bears top .
and then you can accelerate the particles strong enough , and then they go into the onion .
and the commercial device costs about 15 thousand 000 dollars ups upwards or something like that , glass donors about 50 .
so it doesn ' t have the same efficiency , but it ' s basically possible .
so and that , right now , is the core aim of the scene is to increasing this availability of technology and also increase the information and understanding that more people can engage involved in it . and
because , as said at the beginning , it ' s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little knowledge about it , and have no chance to get really good at . because
because if you just read about it , from secondary literature , it ' s not the same as made it or saw seen it yourself . because
and i think technology is becoming more and more important in our modern societies .
and if you , also , an informed citizen to make meaningful decisions in society and talk , then you need the access to knowledge and technology .
and you also have to do it and understand it in order to do it and understand it .
and that then operates under the slogan open knowledge and citizen science .
so , as citizens you re em able to deal with these scientific technologies .
and that ' s the core concern of the biohackers .
these are the people who at least officially registered themselves on the website , d . i . y . bio - dot - . org website .
this ' is a pretty remarkable number of people around the world .
and what ' s interesting is that they ' re also represented in southeast asia .
that ' s what i think there ' re fewer people in there than they actually exist .
so i know about some who haven ' t signed involved .
and these are just the biohacker now , the individual people .
in part also with these hackerspace , are put in these places together there .
and but that ' s at the very beginning .
as i said , two thousand it just begun .
and hackersps , so the computer hacksp , because the c - base in berlin was the first , nine hundred - foot big .
and this has now become a huge network of very good , yes , infrastructure centers that are represented all over the world .
and we hope , of course , that we keep spread the same and then also equally well - connected , so that we can more people can be involved in it .
and i ' d invite everyone to deal with it and also to try something myself .
now it ' s not that simple now , but it ' s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity and you put enough energy in there , you can get far there .
thank you for listening .
that ' s it .
yeah , hello .
how do we humans actually work ?
that ' s a question that really gets me very as a designer , but also in the of usability and all of all things in user experience . this .
it ' s about how to meet people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and they create a as satisfying experience . it
because i believe that the interactive media inside us addresses archaic cognitive models , are paradigms that have been programmed in our biological memory a very , very long time ago , and that we can be create that directly through interactive media . because . because .
and this is very amazing , because you actually believe that this high - technology that you ' re encounter seeing is actually bringing you into the future , but in fact , it ' the future is right with us in our archaic roots .
so what are archaic models ?
i just written four words , and i ' d like to explain them briefly .
to archaic cognitive models , that are these are the models that we ' ve learned in the pre - industrial times .
one to these archaic models is that we have a basically natural relationship to virtuality .
that basically sounds unusual at first .
but i ' m going to go into that in a moment , i ' m going to prove you that you also have a natural relationship with virtuality .
the second thing is that since because of these archaiccs models , we ' re certainly able to speak very , very visually , even though we using a coded language today . and the
and the third area , which actually explain explains itself .
we all know that the interactive media is nonlinear by definition , in involves the denial of linearity , and which of course , tells us that we feel linearity as normal today .
the fourth thing is that history for us is a place of information spreading .
what about virtuality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world ?
i ' d like to prove to you that .
how many doors does the house that you live in ?
we ' re not be able to spontaneously answer them immediately , but it ' s going to happen and it ' s happening right now . we
they go through this house that they live in , and they look at how many doors there are .
and that ' s what they do .
they virtualize reality without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and ' s what we ' re str to media campus , for example , the virtual reality in our v . r . lab , and we can actually do it all the time .
and this power to virtualize virtual reality that people had in the pre industrial mad , because they had nothing .
they didn ' t have books . they
or they didn ' t have any photocopy .
they didn ' t have mass media .
the only thing they had was their head .
and in that head , the memory turned off .
in this head , knowledge was collected , and with these virtual images , the imagination , knowledge was also passed on .
and that ' s why it ' s also so deeply embedded in us that we can deal with virtuality so well .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can take a little trip .
yes , that can be done .
the interesting thing about this is that at that time , man was both media producer and medium themselves .
now , if you think a little further .
what is media today ?
then you ' ll notice that there has been a change .
but i ' ll talk about that in a minute .
the tool of information processing has always been stories for since .
shaman , priests , so - called knowledge guards , were label extra to keep knowledge in stories .
and today , we ' re still very , very heavily on stories .
the author of the book , " the storytelling , jonathan gottschall , that we still spend a thousand hundred hours a year resing stories .
this means for a child who has spent most until the age of most of his life pre contenting stories .
now we think our love of stories is because child sat on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far forgotten .
this goes a lot further back to the pre - industrial cultures .
but for me , in the interactive media , what is particularly amazing is that we haveherent embedded in our biological memory , the ability to think nonlinear .
i brought you an example of the north american tribe of nootaka indians tribe .
and their lives lived in the coast region of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very island - rich area , and you had to sort of navigate there , come from island to island to get food . and
and they did this with what we call called lead maps .
you may know that if you ' re interested a little bit from the australian aboriginal americans .
they have similar principles .
they don ' t have lead maps , they ' ve used the so gend songlines or dream paths .
and what ' s interesting thing about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions be spread over songs be .
where they language was classified of lower status .
that is , you navigated through sound and over rhythm .
and these sounds and that rhythm have the geology , the topography of a region , and that of course , also allowed you to rearrange these songs and put together differently , and move back left , to right and back to the destination . and . and
but why don ' t we sing to get from top from a to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what actually happened ?
happens is this is the so genent machine age .
we moved in what we s called the vog age .
what happened is the machine age , and happened is the book , and happened this is photocopy .
and that ' s exactly what happened that we have shifted responsibility for our memories and our production of our individual memories to external media .
on the book and on the picture .
so unfortunately , we have taught god ' s a bit to virtualize . so
virtuality has suddenly become alien to us alien us and has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous design researcher at the strand university , has gone so far to say that mass media , he means the book and the image , so not the television , the internet and so on , and so on , what we now call mass media , that these mass media have fossilized our memories and eclipsed our ability to virtualize .
let ' s make a little jamcard . let
from the vog age to the machine age .
what does the affects our understanding to our thinking and our memory ?
then that these are the fa effects of pre - industrial cultures .
and they will have been over more and more over the centuries by the influence of the machine age .
that is , instead of remi individualize remembernding ours us , we have standardized , widely distributed , mass - distributed patterns of memories that we can atta hang our personal memories to .
we no longer make produce ourselves .
we have an abstract language a abstract language .
we no longer think imagine the thing in pictures , things are no longer in picturesmore , but we encode it our language .
we ' ve become used to things happen linear .
and we accepted linearity as a law , and there are only exceptions , such like non - linearity .
what we have left is storytelling .
we ' re still arrested very , very heavily victim information processing .
the question is , what ' s coming next ?
we had the vog age , we had the machine age , and we ' re now exploring what we call called the cyber age .
this it sounds very fun , and it sounds very much like science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of the cyber age that bring us restore these possibilities backiscover our capabilities .
it ' s about virtuality , it ' s about non - linearity , it ' s about storytelling .
i want to explain that a little bit for second .
there are technical concepts like augmented reality , which is extended reality .
so if you look at google glasses , for example , this is a concept that let us combine the virtual world with the real world , which is , our affinity for virtualization , to feeling the virtual as something normal , natural is addressed again . so
another example is what ' s called virtual reality . as crazy as , of may sound in the context of my talk , we ' re physically moving in non - existing virtual worlds to the model of the holocaust .
and other another example is the environments , intelligent systems .
these are spaces that can respond intelligently to a human being .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
i finished , and i hope the video works , brought a very , very beautiful project , which is the bachelor ' s of michael burk , ann - kathrin krenz , joris klause and jan - moritz muller . i
and the two are also here today .
maybe you can get up for a second so you can talk to the two about the project in the a break .
and i brought this project i as an example of how , expressed at these archaic cognitive models .
it whole is a game , i have to say about .
of course , is extremely to storytelling , and it ' s a computer game .
and when i say computer game , you ' re very likely in front that any people will messiawling in front of any console , or that they ' re playing with them with any console in their hand . and
anyway , they do that inside there .
this is a game outside game .
and this is specifically meant for me to discover the outside world , so is i rediscover the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , which is the data , the data space that we produce , to the real world .
i apologize for i have to short cut so .
you can explain that much better , so there ' s more a lot more to it .
and that is what that ' s about discovering a city by looking at where places been positive or negatively splited in .
and so i get a very different view of the city , a very different impression of the , which is that i see negative and positive zones of a city , and so i get a very different virtual map of a very real city .
and we can like to look at this .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little explanation of what you ' re going to see in a moment .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , it ' s clear .
and with a kind of a flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
so , i ' d like to wr sumriz sumap sume my talk , in the sense that the properties and the skills that we ' ve acquired from the bra age , and that have gone us so a little bit dali in the machine age , that can be activated through what ' s called the cyber age , and that we in this way we over about complex , technological , new products the future , but actually come back to our roots . so i , but actually come back
thank you . thank
yes , i ' m very happyd to be able to be with you .
i ve just been asked whether this sack is a talking bag , it ' going to speak instead .
he ' s not going to do that .
i ' m also going to resolve what ' s in there . i
but so far i ' m only doing it a little bit curious .
yes , kids are naturally curious , or should be curious , designers too .
i ' m an home , so of course , i ' m also dealing with curiosity and how does curiosity changes our thinking again , and why might we lose curiosity and we have to re - it and so on and so on .
this is a whole range of things that you ' re dealing with besides beyond actual existence as an designer .
when professors get curious , they ' re often put into research offices like this .
and that ' s also what i ' ve had in the last half the year .
a research chair on natural user interface design .
now you ' re going to wondering , why do all these designers begin to deal with such natural , archaic of communication , interaction and so on and so on ?
and i ' m just holding one of these little devices , because things are supposed to get more intuitive , more natural , more useable , and you have to stop look at , what is actually natural for us humans , what is useable or intuitive .
and in the background , i ve been in natural user interface design , which is the next generation in context human computer , where in the relationship of the human computer , about how our tools , or how the computer moves from colossive to the digital assistant . and .
so i ' ve been looking at when is what natural or intuitive .
maybe have to take a gli look to it again .
why is this happen at ?
so if we look at the evolution of our society , briefly , we ' re moving from the third to the fourth generation of society or social form .
so from modern to the computer society .
every society is shaped by a primary medium .
at the beginning , the tribal society through language .
that is , you ' ve found yourself by speaking a common language , you could communicate with each other , you ' ve moved into the same cave , or you moved into other areas , you ' ve created cities , or created villages , and you ' ve created a tribal society of .
but the primary medium was language , something very natural , something very living .
now you also have had to learn , so no child can talk from nature , but we learn it crusionsively and relatively natural .
that was then replaced by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a huge boom the time , because of course , you started manifest the living language in the form of writing , which is what that is fluid and alive , i start and crush it in stone , and i manipulate it .
depending on how i kick and when i kick , of course , it ' s a very different narrative than if there ' s one living sort of one .
but then succriptusly picked this script as a primary medium , got entrance .
then came the next generation that which we ' re actually live primarily today .
this is the print and print writing with guth and others .
at the time , it was just an front where nobility , boatrgy and others have said , if you re really insane when people start reading , people would want to talk afterwards , and of course that ' s totally fatal .
and now we come into the next generation , and the exciting thing is , such a generation change is just every a few hundred years , and we ' re now really in this generation in this phenomenal phase that we ' re doing this . and
of course , course disfusd confused , because we see on the one hand the new media , socil social media , facebook and so and so on . and
with total transparency , what the new thinking is , what ' s banging on the old thinking , don doesn ' t say that in lasagna is horse meat and no beef or other phenomena , i just want to misaplivee that and i just want to do that .
and these two worlds are spining together , new and old thinking . and
the exciting thing about this is , if you look at this , this new society , this computer society , draws a lot of mechanisms , principles and archaic paradigm from the tribal society . the
but now no longer at the local level , but at a global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that ecology is a global one .
not if i think locally ecologically here , and the neighbor thinks less ecologically , it whole doesn ' t work anymore . not
that is , from the local village has actually become a global village with the same principles , as natural , as intuitive , but also total transparency . that
just as you knew in the village , who has something about whom and when , is what is sing today about this extension of ourselves through these mobile end devices at a global scale .
it be that we know that globally and acclate faster and more and better .
as it used to happen in the village .
in the background , i just looking at looking at , what does it mean , what is still natural for us , what may we may have learned , what is instinctive for us , so what makes the difference ? .
because a of people come , they can ' t make it use friendly so anyone can deal with it . because
so you have to deal with what that means , and not just change it that it ' s different , but it s has to get better .
and when , is , of course , a little intuitive , and how can i influence , as an architect and design things so that they ' re a user - friendly , so ' as intuitive , because then they ' re fun and they ' re easy to use ? and
you also , also during studies , on the of perception and perceptual psychology .
and this is , of course , something where you start and look and say , " okay , now i ' m just look into the inside .
and what does it really look like in there ?
so how do we work when we look in there ?
and what does actually , of course , intuitively , and how do our channels of perception work , and how does cognitive processing work ?
because steve jobs once said you need to dig deeper to understand how it works .
so you really have to look in the detail when i want to make something useable or intuitively manageable , which means at the heart . so
and what you can see that is that you add a our seven senses , most people think we only have five , it ' s even already seven , there ' s certainly the next sense , eight sense in the near , and as an extension ourselves again . and . and
and to look at , how do we process information , how do we absor information ?
just saying , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
a lot of people use the word , but they don ' t even know what it means in a detail .
but i have to understand at the basica , in nature , when does information become information , when information data become information and from information again , so that i know how to can make things as intuitive or natural manageable . but
and of course , how does design affects perception ?
we see here , when i design things , i can make them confusing , like on the right side , where i don ' t know what ' s salt and pepper , or i can sort make them sort of intuitively by showing things .
so a lot more natural , in a vessel , but i kind of see right where ' s salt and pepper in there .
and when i tell someone , give me salt or pepper , on the right , they ' ll think about where ' s in there .
and on the left , just intuitively access the , and then hopefully hope that there ' s no sugar in there , just give the salt accordingly . and
but also our perception themselves , how is it fooling us .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the small circle , even although that ' s not the case at all , but they ' re just the same size , and yet our perception changes depending on which context we put things in .
does anybody know what that is ?
come on .
pattern recognition should still work .
that ' s where it ' s getting more of my glasses .
so it ' s a circle .
a second circle is already beginning to correlate or associate some certain similarity .
and then when i put a halfbocle there , a suddenly we don ' t see just one unitmore , which is circle , circle , and , but we see one unit , we don ' t see three parts , one circle , one circle , another one .
this is called the shape law , or shape psychology , which also affects us in perception .
it ' s important for the designers , who usually to have this in the first semester , the great design laws .
shape law of closeness , shape law of continuity and so on .
often in third time , they ' re forgotten again .
but that ' s an essentially important part , if you want to make things as intuitive way well .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is vision .
sounds kind tril first , but it ' s pretty exciting when you get into it .
so we have eyes the front , and now you think we ' re looking from the front back to the back .
that ' s wrong .
you see from the back forward .
that they project an assumption forward that they see something you they recognize , example , circle .
that is , we project our vision before we see it , bring it back into our visual apparatus to say , okay .
i have a cognitive feedback , you ' ve designed something you want to see .
that ' s there , that comes back .
then it goes back forward , because the back doesn ' t mout in the front and says , now please really look again and sure if what you see is also what you want to see .
and then it goes back , and then it ' s actually seen . and
so a very , very exciting process of how certain things happen , and what millisecond these things happen . so
i don ' t know who knows you this picture .
that ' s exactly the same thing i just described to .
now everyone from of this pattern is trying to see something .
i don ' t know who recognizes something .
does anybody see something particular ?
a dalai lama , exactly .
once i saw this that there a dalai lama in there , you know that .
you ' ll never forget it anymore , because i ' ll show you where the dalai lama is .
now you see the dalai lama .
and then on , now you always see it . and
that is , i ' ve actually spokusbeden them fact that they don ' t see a pattern likemore , but i ' ve conditioned within a amount of time to see this dog again in this hilarious picture .
and this is this projection of vision , feedback , vision .
now i know , and now i ' m projecting forward that i see the dalai lama .
i see the dalai lama .
so very , very exciting processes that which then happen in this , yes , it ' not gray , but it ' s here in this pink mass .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
this is our present .
so , it ' s also always interesting to know as a designer .
if i know something it takes three seconds for to sort of step from the present into the past , i can also bridge very good waiting bysing someone three seconds .
he has to process that as a present .
then it goes into the past , and so i can bridge very elegant wait , for example , at the computer , if i know this phenomenon .
what takes five and a half milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
it ' s also very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time when you fall in love .
that means awareness , if you know this now , watch at who you look at long , because i don ' t take any proof of what can happen accordingly .
and fifteen milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the period of most perceptions that we have .
that is , this first impression is happening at a rapidly fast pace that we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we pay attention to , and how we sort of protect against our environment , so we can think about it accordingly .
of course , designers are not just concerned with of perceptions and neural processing or cognitive psychology , but primarily naturally with the issue of human - object relationship .
so how does a person deal with certain things accordingly ?
there ' s productically the practical functions , so formal aspects or formalistic aspects .
there are sign functions where i know exactly where i actually have to reach .
but there ' s also symbolic functions , why does anyone for a little pocket of where hardly hardly anything fit into , out such horrende amounts of money , even though it ' s not that practical ? but
there we are more at the symbolic , at the level meaning that we , of course , course deal with as designers .
back to my actual issue of natural user interface , and the issue that of course behind course , is usability .
usability always means how can i achieve a certain goal as quickly or how can a user in a particular context achieve as effectively , efficient and satisfying achieve a goal ?
that ' s how it more the norm .
how can i make something as useable ?
can i use this directly , or i need a manual , or i need a corresponding training to do it .
and it is less usa or user - friendly .
that i make it differently and make more beautiful doesn ' t mean it ' s better manageable .
you also have to understand that .
and then if you look at the software that we just saw it , you ' ll also understand why nine and a percent of our software is not intuitive or not , including the i - pad in many areas or i - phone , even though it ' s much more intuitive than classic software .
and intuitive use has ' t only been since apple becomes a fundamental economic factor , a fundamental success factor , if i want to make technological devices to humans .
why ?
because most of the time , through this new kind of use , which is natural user interfaces , we ' re five times faster on the average at our target . because
you have to imagine that if you do something of the classic software , it takes five hours and only with this new kind of natural software , an hour .
that doesn ' t mean that you can probably go home for four hours , but your employer or somebody will think of how to engage them with the four hours .
but i want to say that , of course , it ' s a corresponding performance increase in us to do certain things as well . but
so if we go back into the realm software , here were the first command line interfaces , which were very abstract , where it took months to deal with these systems . and
then the next people who ' ve already been working with nem neural model or mental model like the software eergonome , which is you had an idea of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to use the computer use .
so no more zeros and ones or cryptic codes , but a metaphor .
that s made it whole a lot more useable , but of it s gets much better .
the next generation of graphic use platforms is already working a lot more with behavior .
so that ' s , as an architect , i more to design behavior more than looks . so
this is also a paradigm shift .
that of a sudden i think that look looks is becoming more and insignificant to success , especially the usability is becoming an application .
and then if i take one step further into these natural user interfaces , where i by voice , by language , by touch , by gesture and no longer by mouse and cursor i have to control things , i ' m even faster and even more immediate . and
but that also leads brings me back to the point , when are things get more intuitive ?
if you get more intuitive , and then i have to back brushoat back my little friend here and look , what does that mean from cognitive economics , when is something intuitive too ?
and this to for us humans , is always a little intuitive if i have to think about it as little . and
so , he doesn ' t like to think , but to make it relatively simple . so .
the less i think about it in way , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for the designer ?
that is , if we look that we can transfer existing models of action from one to something else , like the metaphor , then i can takeplo that as an designer .
that is , i can just transfer an intuitive human model of to a software to and make the software much more useable .
, of course , the question is , what is actually the most intuitive para of human humans , and now i ' ve told you . ?
this is what ' s the osit model .
this is s what each of us use , and osit is an acronym , and it stands for orientation , selectng , inform , transcate .
that ' s what each of you does that all the time , but he does it unconsciously and sort of intuitive or partly instinctiveive .
the model is already displayed in the womb , and it ' s cross - cultural , so it works around the worldwide for young and old , and it ' s used by us all the time , without most of us knowing that this model was there .
osit ost itself becomes about 50 to 70 thousand times of us on activity , so in sleep you ve found that it ' s less often than a day .
i can now just orient this mental model of action , select , inform , trans to an interaction system .
and through this kind of transmission , much like the metaphor of the desktop , but now no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a pattern of action , a plot principle of action .
and this is on a higher grail of userness than the transfer of a classic metaphor , which is the desktop . and
and if i translate this now , for example , where ifer as control , select as choice , inform in that case , it ' s getting up to me , i can look at it in the detail , and yes , translating means i can also throw it that somewhere or send somebody or a and so on . and so . i throwfer throwfer email send writefer
then i can transmit the whole thing .
i ' ll try to try that through an example .
everybody ' s eaten cake .
coverage : now i ' m kind of interact with the object , can zoom out , can zoom in .
i get the whole overview , now i can filter this , and i can say , just show me all the stuff about chocolate , for example .
and suddenly have an interface , which is much more intuitive and much more natural .
because that i can reach things like the pieces , touch , and they come up to me is much more natural than if talking , about hierarchical organized websites or other mechanisms to sort of make these things available . because
imagination is more important than knowledge , and with that sentence , i ' d also like to end close with giving a and the clue , designers need to think differently to come up with new solutions , and in that sense , i thank you very much for your attention and request .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first thing when you grow up as a child , as a baby , is that you take care about what choices you have , right ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed them to play more or less in the kitchen , the more , you a way , of course your curiosity , course , spark by .
and the curiosity is not learned .
that ' s why everyone who ' s here and are curious actually people who have a trait that you can ' t learn .
i ' m now implementing basically all this whole environmental debate , world union , 40 years of club - of - rome , in quality .
and there ' s a central point about this .
and it ' s based on phosphorus . and
give pee a chance .
every day they give + - they give a scale about two grams of phosphorus , and every day they have to absorb two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise they can ' t have teeth .
they can ' t store energy . they
they can ' t have bones . they
we could only flde around the oceans as amormor mollus shells .
if , we don ' t absb up phosp and release phosphorus .
amazingly , we ' re dealing with something here that would be actually natural , but it ' s not that .
because everybody talks about energy , but nobody talking about the phosphorus problem . because .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have phosphorus for two , and already , phosphorus mining is put a lot more uranium into the environment than is used in all nuclear plants . we
in the last 20 years alone , fifteen thousand tons of uranium been distributed in our fields in germany .
and we take it all . and
it causes leukemia in children .
and we think we ' d protect the environment if we ' re a little less harmful .
so , for example , protect the environment , drive less car .
protect the environment , make less waste .
protect the environment , use less energy .
but that ' s not protection .
it ' s like i said , protect your child , just beat it three times instead of five times .
that ' s just a little less destruction .
if we think from grgh to baher , all of our earth will becomes sooner or a grave . if
that ' s thinking from weigh to weigh .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as the first time .
there ' s over 60 percent of the carbon in stored in the soil .
right now , we ' re building corn and we ' re losing between 11 and 30 kilograms of 30 tons per hectare , or on the square meter .
that is , we ' re losing about five thousand times more ground than we get re - formed .
of course , we can look at the waste problem first .
and everything is packaging or content .
for in , openbach , for example , 20 percent of the wastebage is now rollingling .
and as we get older , the napkins get bigger .
that ' s they ' re sort of all in the fore phase .
yeah ? .
a baby needs about six thousand nappies .
of course , could reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is coordinated in china in a second .
that ' s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we deal with these napkins ?
here ' s the evidence , by the way , that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is released the pigs .
in people over the urine .
yeah .
so men can ' t be pigs .
because that ' s evidence for with it , ' t it ?
traditionally , think in the environmental debate , we ' re too many in the world .
and if you accuse people , if you prete people , if you say that was better , you weren ' t there at all , they become subious and hostile . and
and so someone like al gore , one of our great heroes , says there ' s nothing more important than stabilizing the human population .
in israel , if you save a human life , you save the earth .
this it says , the more you kill , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , the ants weigh about four times more than we humans do .
i could also take termites , but in the united states nobody likes termites that far , even though they ' re vegetarian .
that means the ants weigh a lot more than we do .
and because they work much lot harder than we do and because they only live three to six months , they in their weight , a little 30 billion people in energy consumption .
that means we ' re not too many , we ' re too stupid , right ?
and where you can see how far we ' re away from , what we really wanted to do and could do , and how sad we are that we ' re even on earth at all , you can see , for example , openbach has a program , until 20 40 , you want to be climate - neutral here , right ? and
they can only be climate - neutral if they don ' t exist , right ?
the only opportunity .
have you ever seen a climate - neutral tree ?
yeah ? .
a one ? .
that means all of our intelligence means that we want to be stupid than trees , right ?
yeah ? .
no tree is carbon neutral .
fortunately not , yes ?
there is no overpopulation problem of trees .
there are still six hundred billion trees in the amazon alone .
have you ever heard about overpopulation problems of trees ?
that means all of our intelligence means that we want to be stupid than trees .
and where you see , even in something like demeter , the most rigorous bio - yes agriculture , doesn ' t allow our own metabolbolic products to go back .
so every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really need to go back .
and we ' re too many with them that .
just about that .
that means we feel so guilty on the earth that we say , there ' s no bio - farming , no biologist , there ' s no nature et pro , and what they all call that allow our own ex -ments to go back . no bio
isn ' t that sad ?
so we ' s re too many with .
it ' s certainly useful to be less harmful about in terms of oil use .
but where are we useful ?
we ' re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it ' s about having a big footprint that ' s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the highest is not to be there , right ?
zero emissions , yes ?
you can only have zero emissions if you ' re not there .
even if they shoot themselves now , they would have emissions .
so you can ' t solve that it at all .
we can do it differently . we
we can regain our nutrients back .
we do agriculture in brazil in the countries where we recover the nutrients back .
directly , we can get nutrients back in agriculture in this way .
we , do this in china , for example , where we directly take the waste off it .
in china , a night pot today still called honey pots , sort , yeah ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid to bring our nutrients back .
that is , the entire western civilization - history is characterized by that the city has always took , but never given anything back to the farmers .
and so s the cities had to grow and more , because the farmers went to the cities , and the cities had to get their nutrients further . and .
that ' s why all the western empires are always expanding until they didn ' t make the infrastructuremore , and then they ' ve imp collapsed .
yeah ? .
in china , it was different .
they ' ve done devaless civilization over five thousand years , because you ' ve always able to bring the nutrients back .
even today , when they re invited to dinner in china , expected after to stay until they visit the toilet .
because it ' s easy to walk and take the nutrients .
they invited them to they invited them to dinner , not for nutrient stealing .
that is , you can see on the internet how to reclaim the nutrients back .
the real beauty of this is , if you do this , so you do agriculture , produces biogas on a hectare of land of five thousand people in favelas , a farmer can produce about a thousand - thousand dollars and wait the facility to grow chickens and pigs and ducks and vegetables and fish .
and the great thing about this is that the crime rate in the favelas goes down over nine percent .
so we don ' t have to control people being as little as bad . so
we can support them be good .
this is , of course , high - tech agriculture , but the plants are carry themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they ' re designed by the design that a farmer can just manage them .
that means that ' s where the crime rates go back .
and none of these facilities , we ' ve now built over 100 meters in the last 20 years , none of these facilities have ever been beaten . and
you could throw a liter of altol in easily , and then the facility would be ruine for years .
it ' not happening . isn
that means we don ' t have to control people doing as little as bad .
we can support them be good .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
and by the way , if you want to do something about it , write down , in germany , the best suited of all seitation is this one in rotterdam .
unfortunately , not in frankbach , but maybe you can help the dutch a little bit .
because the rotterdam plant could best regain the phosphorus .
and he has to go back . and .
we see the that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it works .
we ' ve now deployed over three years in netherlands . we
the dutch government has declared they will be the first country in the world to extract phosphorus back .
but we need that overall .
you know , there are two countries that control almost eight percent of the world ' phosphorus reserves .
there the opec is a bunch of orphanages .
these are six and a half countries control 40 percent of the oil reserves .
and we will be able to replace the oil with other energy sources .
but will won will be able to replace the phosphorus .
it ' s not about making the existing a little bit less bad , it ' s about doing something right .
and first of all , all is ask what the right thing is .
that means it ' s about efficiency , it ' s not about efficiency .
in holland , of course , it ' s easier because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yeah ? .
imagine , for example , if your wife is sad , when you rebel her it , and you come with 50 roses .
completely inefficient .
but absolutely effective , right ?
or take a lip paint .
a woman in germany eats about six - in three kilograms during her lifetime . a
and there .
this ' is scientifica not correct , scientific , because we don ' t know how much is s . this
but a lip , even in this lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but quite effective , right ?
one everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
that ' s not resource efficiency , ' but efficiencycy .
to ask , what ' s the right thing ?
not to burn the ref bulb a little bit better and paste it and lose in the internalrige all the materials for circulation , but to first time ask , how do you close cycles ?
think imagine about mozart efficiently .
yeah ? .
when i invite her for dinner and say , yes , there ' s a pill of open - brown taster and a glass of water on it .
wonderful , ' right ?
that ' s efficient .
everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
yeah ? .
that is , everything that counts in life is not about saving , avoiding , reducing .
the whole environmental debate .
we tell people , oh , you don ' t have an environmental awareness in the south .
no , the throw away is exactly the right thing do , right ?
at every place you throw away , from , yes , you create life again .
but the wrong things .
if you throw the wrong things , you have a wastebage problem .
how we think from the north .
there ' s every footprint is disadvantage there .
when you walk , yes , every footprint destroys the ground .
because the soil will , the mosses will die , and the wind and the water will wash away the soil .
but if you ' re in italy , every footprint means that the water stays in the meadow longer .
so , it ' s about creating a big footprint that becomes a wetlands .
not guilt management .
we say sustainability in germany .
yeah ? .
but when i ask you , how are you with your wife ?
then what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , dear pity , yes ?
that ' s the minimum .
so don not t save , refuse , avoid .
every waste is nutrient .
and it ' s a pleasure when in italy , you see people in the high bow throwing out a coke can out of the car .
because , you know , that ' s a fun process .
it ' s a form of territory behavior , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
for example , we developed an ice cream pack , which is liquid at room temperature .
they can throw them away where they go and stand .
in two hours , it builds everywhere .
and it contains seeds from rare plants , so that they by throwing away to biodiversity .
that means we ' re useful , not less harmful about it .
so there are two cycles emerge .
not this is supposed to be compostable , of course .
a television or a washing machine , you only use them , they don ' t use them .
just the things that sho up , like shoe shoes , like brakes , like car bikes , they have to be that they go into biological systems .
the things that are only being used go into technical systems .
but today we ' re just talking about biological systems .
yeah ? .
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
direct advertising , not for the company nike per se , but for you now helping this company make these products successfully .
because we don ' t ' t longer make things free anymore .
yeah ? .
so , when i invite you to eat and say this ' s free of roches , it doesn ' t help you at all .
no , we ' re to see what ' s inside of it .
positive .
so not like detox .
not toxic inside it .
it everything that ' s inside it is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can put the sala on the pedestrian and the rubber can go into biological cycles , right ?
all of this is compble from it .
and if we do , of course , we can do it for adidas , for nike , for cows and muller and the whole textile industry . and
and that ' s half of all the wastewag problems in the world that are caused by the textile industry .
so ' re helping with , ask people .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
because they ' ve changed the chairman twice .
and i ' m not so sure they really stay there .
so , help me a little bit that .
but it can goes . but
yeah .
what s just been presented .
this can s done .
we can now make things so that if they wear , if they break , they can go into biological cycles .
technical cycles are also the same way .
there ' s a direct back system for this .
this is the first ecological backpack , in fact , designed to go back into the cycle .
again also that , so in every store , you can get things back .
if you get , right ?
do you remember the napkins again ?
if right now , that ' s waste . if .
all these nappies lying around , almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
up there on the landes , but also else in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastics so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water storage , inside , they can just go back on cellulose based , then you can plant trees with a baby in israel or in tunisia of half .
yeah ? .
just if you take these napkins , you shri it them up , sterilize it , and take the powder to plant trees .
so the baby is carbon factor for the life , from the beginning .
so , we don ' t need to be climate - neutral , we can be climate - positive .
it ' s kind of a beneficial poop print .
yeah , you of .
yeah ? .
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything .
i started an institute to this .
now there are a lot of people working there , and they can all engage .
there ' s a club in this , cradle to cradle club , where anyone can participate .
so no longer save , avoidel , avoid , reduce , not gui management , but intelligent waste .
does you make that curious ?
thank you .
the work of the interprete .
music as a language . music
in the description of my talk , it says that as an interpretr , i understand myself as a translator , so in the english word .
singers are translators of written notes into sound music .
that as a translator you have not just translate word by word translate the text into another language , but also to understand the deeper sense of words and word relations so to it make a meaningful translation , anyone who has to do with other languages .
translate from german to english can take more knowledge , except when you comes to poetry or even poetry .
but it ' s strange to amateurs about what we musicians do with our music language .
as an interpreti of a piece of music , i first write the written notes . as .
you probably think the composer put wrote exactly everything that he thought of .
in fact , the notes are very vague and flawl .
these notes are about as accurate or unigul as a verbal , although very seemingly vague accurate , description of a landscape .
because in this verbal landscape description , the smell of the flowers is not smell , aver the degree of green , not to hear the sciing of the wind , not to feel it . because
that is , the interpreteer has to translate that unaw statements of notes language into another , which is audible , concrete , nonverbal language . that
today i want to translate you what i otherwise trans musically , which i interpret , into a verbal language .
so basicalylly a translation of translation . so
so i prefer i rather do it in into german , because if i had to translate it into english again , it would be equivalent to the translation of the translation of the translation . so
so the , the music works for me the much like spoken language .
the written notes have the function of the letters of a script .
so it ' s not enough just to learn notes and print the keys there on the piano or the right place on a violin note .
because these were just the letters you learned to paint .
the of letters is only when you can understand the language to do it .
so for the learning process of music , need take music at least as long as spoken language .
there ' s also devi , whether you learn it for home use , just passively understand or you can speak actively , up to the musical native speaker .
the actor ' s starts the same as a theater director .
after you choose a piece to play , because you ' re excited about it , you research for the background of the emergence of the composition .
you collect information about the this piece in secondary literature .
you read in the letters , the diaries , the notes , or whether there are words , thoughts of the composer himself .
you study the works that he composed before and after .
you make comparisons .
the reasons for of writing it .
how and what did he feel ?
what were his circumstances , like society and politics ?
that ' s all interest interests me all .
you think into that time by looking at contemporary images or reading literature .
but over time , as an , you have a rich knowledge about the composer that you often play , and it ' s easier and easier for you to think into him and feel . but
the composer becomes more and more the friend you live with .
his cause of writing the piece becomes more and more my personal cause of playing it .
now that the notes are not but a detailed record of the composer ' s issue , but just a framework , i ' m apply this framework to rev fill it with meaning and meaning . now
i then say with my own words what might be written between this framework .
i ' m play explaining what these notes might mean .
now for me and for the composer back then time and what you might mean for him today . now
every tone , every phrase makes a sense it because i feel it myself , because it comes from my now personal lived now .
it has to be harmony for vocal in the present and now , otherwise i can ' t convince my audience that ' s my cause .
it ' s a very happy concert every again if i can have to have the experience , the piece that i ' ve developed in advance as i to re - experience .
how you per - experience a happy new day over and over again , even though always with the same rituals of life , stand up , breakfast , going to work , i experience the same piece over and over again the again .
i got back a day , change seasons , my pulse slow down night slower night than in the morning night , in a concert hall it takes longer for the sound to come back than at home . i . i
i take the audience ' breath , consciously or unconsciously .
all of this affects me , and all of this also affect my experience of composition .
what ' s very wonderful is when i ' m on the stage with a double partner , and we have the same wavelength . it .
then the same thing happens in a good , intitic conversation .
you put a new idea in there , and immediately it ' s answered with a reaction .
it ' s exciting , because then things that we haven ' t practiced so way and what you can ' t sample .
it ' s a lot of fun to make music in this way , and then you as the audience experienced seen the music communicate with alive .
so each concert is a different concert .
i will never going to play the any way like i did in right this now .
i can ' t play the today as i did in 20 years . i
i ' m going to have more life experience than i today , and i ' m going to have range of much more color potential , of emotions and feelings than i have today .
i ' , i ' ll probably throw some pots of paint out , but i can get new ones .
i have a nice concrete example of this .
it was on a piano course for music students with my beloved old teacher , professor jurgen ude , a famous beethoven specialist , concert pianist and long - term professor of the music university here in stugar . it
unfortunately , i was far too young , so he was already eme when i finally started studying .
but i was very lucky to meet him very early on , at was 13 years old , and so i was on his classes when i high school . but
i was 17 when i returned took again in one of his courses , and i played the last of the four ballads of chopin , a late work .
he asked me what the introduction of this ballad was for me .
that ' s such a worn part .
and in my youthcence , i said , expectation .
and he was smd and said , yeah ?
that has to be the age difference of .
because for me , it means memory .
he was been over 60 years .
well , at seven , you just have dreams , but you don t no significant memories .
i play the piece today every few years , and it ' s always changed for me , even though no single note has changed .
every time it ' s exciting , because every over and over again i read out something new .
an example of this from a very different area . monet painted the sea lion x times .
it ' s always the same garden , but at different times , with different light .
he translated the sea seals different , as he saw them , as they looked to him at that moment .
his personal impressions of the sea lion .
the x - mali interpretation of a piece is comparable to this . the
now i ' m also older than chopin at two and a half years when he wrote the piece .
he ' s only lived for nine and a half years .
and i ' m important to keep look keep in the notes , even though i think i can memorize them .
to keep speak sign language , directly with the composer .
because the notes are the only connection directly to him .
especially when he ' s already died .
now , how do you start speak the language of music ?
i said , it takes about as long as for spoken language .
often the music education is you learn to read the notes first .
you basically learn to read first before you just speak a one word .
you learn to find the notes on the notes on the instrument .
then when all fingers move in time and right as the way it is in the notes , are sounds out that sound like music . and
when this happens error perfectly happens , the student gets the next difficult piece .
interpretation is hard talk about in the early course .
all right , there ' s theo in front of finale , which is a quick piece .
lento , slow .
loud and silent marks , f and b , etc .
that ' s what most of you know here .
but even if you implement these data , there ' s still just something technical .
and still it ' s still not an interpretation .
i wonder .
i m wonder that you often forget about something very fundamental .
that is that to make music on the instrument , your musical should activity and feel should be there before .
that ' s singing .
a child who hasn ' t learned to sing , because parents didn ' t scheme to , will not do it by himself .
it ' s like talking .
it ' s necessary to have your its own experiences and your idea of music and then make it through another possibility , which is through an instrument , sound .
so people who have never singing have never felt directly with your body what it ' s like to make a sound .
design a phrase with your own breath .
because the musical instrument is the extension of our body .
our vocal cords to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the hammerheads in the piano are the sequel of my fingers .
the melody comes from the singing and the rhythm comes from the dance .
the continuous re today with music is not indragtory .
you don ' t need to make music anymore if when you get bored .
no longer necessary to whistle or sing a song .
every music is shut down if you ' re constantly turning on music all the outside .
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do if i can ' t sing ?
the question i ask , can ' t you sing , a , because you think you can ' t sing ?
or b , because they didn ' t learn to sing ?
both of them aren ' not too late to start to see if they can ' t do it , or learn how to use these little muscles that are set the vocal cords .
because you can train that .
or c , because they ' re told that they ' re inadequate .
so i ask , how technically competent was this diagnosis ?
have you got a second line or third line , as you say today ?
or d , you don ' t like music , so you don ' t want have anything to do with it .
but what i ' d regret , because music is a beautiful , communicative thing .
but maybe you can also turn them as well .
well , you see , in all cases no nobody has to be a prospectless candidate .
but please don ' t say me , i don ' t understand about classical music .
i can ' t tell whether if it ' s good or bad .
i ' ll answer , but sure you can tell whether you like it or not .
because i don ' t think anybody says it , i don ' t know if i taste it , because i can ' t cook .
so , they ' re not stop food just because they can ' t cook .
so you don ' t have to rely on classical music either because you don ' t play an instrument . so
listen consciously and tell whether you taste it or not .
whether the music is too kindelled or too sweet to them .
say what you feel .
over time , you get demands , and you want a little more spices in there , or even taste fine differences .
now why am i asking my audience to it to be active ?
because music is a language , and a language is to communicate .
an artwork you never look at has no power to work .
the food that was cookely by a chef or a chef has to be eaten and not just be looked at or replaced recipes .
so please listen when a music is played .
it ' s not just a nice soundpet .
if in an environment where adults actively make music , or at least actively hearing music , a child grows growing up , it ' s very easy for a music teacher to ask , what color is your flower have ? if
now can you also play them in blue too ?
and the child plays , after a memorial break , instead of a red flower now plays a blue flower before .
and this sounds very different from before .
that was the first beginning of a own musical expression .
so the first step to an interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today that was originally written a hundred ago , two hundred , or even three hundred years ago ?
now , the instruments have progressed .
there was no longer instrument bach ' an instrument a piano as a moment .
it was wasn just t not t invented yet .
i think the bach would have been excited if he had the sound possibilities of today ' s modern pianos .
i can today make the sounds ideas that the bach had sound on the modern wing , which a renaissance cem cannot do .
you also know that he heard more than when he had already become deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that an orchestra then rejected was considered unsble .
that ' s why the composers depend on us performers to reinventing the pieces .
so you hear what you ' ve just thought in the mind .
and also what you would think in the mind today .
or what i imagine today , because what you might have thought .
thank you .
you know what ' s annovy ?
have you ever been jeus ?
and what did that feel ?
fucks .
i have a friend who driving a cari .
when i come , with my little v - w nuts and myself next to it , this feeling comes up .
i something shooting through my head .
i say , oo , what do you need a big car ?
that ' s lose losings half of its value in the first year .
and in fact , you work much less than i do .
why do i have to afford a little car like that ?
and then i realize immediately , that ' s unfair .
it ' s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , that unpleasant feeling is gone .
our organism invented a great way to just make such these awpleasant feelings like enalovyppear .
you can also try that with words like revenge or profit or something like .
i want to explain you with this mechanism today or bring something to that ' re unconsciously familiar with . i
the mechanism comes from lie .
but don ' t think about the lie as you may have heard when people say no one is intention to build a wall .
and then smashs stones so it shut your sight .
you see a lie is that the liar himself doesn ' t believe what he ' s saying .
it ' s easily to check that it has very different in mind .
he ' s just foolizingsing you and not himself .
no , the lie i ' m talking about that has to do with fooling yourself .
they need this lie to have a lifesp day , to sustain self - deception .
they can make them less easily , yes , check or down .
they need time .
and there ' s anecdote that you may know .
the spanish painter pablo picasso once painted a woman .
this woman then complained , the portrait wouldn ' t see the same .
picasso replies , just wait .
it ' s going become more and more similar to you . it
at this point , and when you laugh , you realize how important that this lie is and how much time it takes to experience something that artists can tell with us very well .
because artists have a disbed relationship with lying .
the artist sharess you something , and especially this lady , which she doesn ' t see when she just looks in the mirror .
the artist shares you something in a portrait like that you only get familiar with when you look at this artwork over and over again .
then that uncomasant feeling disappears , because it couldn ' t see them similar you , and it ' s getting become more and similar to you .
here you have this mechanism that which we can to use lying as a great invention to stabilize our lifes .
and not only in art , also in the folk tales , in the mythology , in stories , it appears again .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked in the mirror every morning and asked him , who is the most beautiful in the country ?
one day this mirror says , yes , there ' s a more beautiful one .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility comes from that true statement , the mirror can ' t lie comes from that true testimony . and
but we should just be familiar with not t tell a woman that there ' s a more beautiful one somewhere else .
here it ' s necessary to bring what we mean by politically correctness .
we need this lie this point that susguards deception without we can ' t even live .
we have not only in art , in folk literacy , but in science these great lies as .
and there ' s this story of the wife of the bishop of worcheeld .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the origin of species and the descent of man .
that man humans should derive from ape and , yes , at least there be a common ancestor between humans and apes . that .
and then she ran to her husband and said , well , that ' s probably not true what charles ' is writing .
human is supposed to derive from ape or have a common ancestor .
no , no , that can ' t be done .
and if it ' s true , we need to prevent people from getting knowledge about it .
why do we need to prevent people from getting understanding knowledge about something when it ' s true ?
because we can cannot without these benefits without .
because we compare this self - deception , this feeling of being great , descent from the highest creatures , not from such a natural level , from something as unpredictable as a organism that still exists to exist , to a rock , and whatever things , that is impossible us .
so , we can ' t tol do these things all .
we need to prevent people from getting learning about things , especially when they ' re true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanism dissolves and what the traces that it leaves that lead to something different than this great image of ourselves , i want to bring you another story . so . so
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
my wife told me .
she came from school one day , she ' s a teacher , and she told about a student .
an autistic student .
she particularly likes like him because he has a tende to sincerity .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i ' m at the fire department .
and because i ' m in the fire department , i ' m interested in pyromomic things .
yes , you feel it when you ' re happy at this point . there ' s something wrong .
i told my wife , whenever a human being in moral uses the word because , we should try to replace it with the word as though .
do that , and then learn the sentence . even though i ' m in the fire department , i ' m interested in pyrotehic things .
you feel that ' s the real truth behind the arrival .
such a little jack , who he ' s t not interested in firetingping fire .
he ' s interested in fire .
but there are no clubs where we can look around , where you learn how to make fire .
there ' s only the second best thing , which is the fire department .
and there he signed up .
and above that , you don ' t tell your teacher that you ' d like to put fires somewhere and be when the fire comess afterwards later .
no , it just looks much better when we show that we ' re in charge of eli rid out the dangers that others can only do when they just open fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
this link the fact that inside of the box knew that he was actually related to the fire , but he can ' t say that out loud .
here you have this centrirsr between the unconscious and the conscio that hits in immediately without able can do anything about it , and designed the things that you know look very different so that they can sound much better for you and others .
so that s just the words that we also use in the language of politically correct speech over and over again .
in fact , we know that something else is the case .
but we know that when we say that , the social relationshipss are very sensitively disturrupted . but
we can ' t just do that just .
it ' s impossible to present those things in a society that is to work .
so i want to tell you what we ' ve found in my institute .
which logic this deception , this that self - deception , the willingness , a different reality than one that we actually already know in the unconscious is valid to spread outside .
so i want to present you two , maybe three examples of this . and
the first example assumes what many of you know and some of you estimate , very few of you don ' t need at all .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is something spiritual , says leibniz .
it ' s something that is not stop material , material nature .
and if you have people front of you who are the - believe that they have a soul , or you can also say who believe that they ' ve been brought from by the soul to life , they think of it as if the soul is such a mental framework about them , not out of matter , just made out of flesh and blood , something stone , kind of , bound tied to the earth , gone , permmptable , unsrelevantable , yes dead . and . and ,
and now from this soul , you think that somehow present in this cloudy nature , in this ambienty nature , anima is present in latin , the buzz of air , . and .
and when thatff of air pour out over man , it ' s filled with dignity , with spirit , with nature that can only live , with soul .
and then he can just run away .
that ' s the idea of how the soul works .
so it ' s to come from outside to people .
so we should think see of them as something that should reallyly be present to our lives .
and when you have this condition in mind , you understand the logic with which we experience this happiness to improve our world better through a lie .
because now you can apply a three - set .
three - three you still know from school .
now this is a point of point that describes a logic .
that ' , by the way , the hardest part of my talk .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
that is to lie that you can just apply this logic wrong .
in this set of sentence , three sentences come .
the first sentence is , michael argues , there is no soul .
so the second sentence is , if klaus is right , he has no soul .
now there ' s a third sentence .
i particularly highlighted him here .
a third sentence that immediately comes immediately in people who have a strong sense of a soul .
they say who has no soul , who ' s dead and can ' t say anything all .
and here you feel it .
here is s this logic in this , yes , in this decive speech .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , which are logically correct .
because i can say everything .
logic doesn ' t make any statements about reality .
i can say the president is a man .
and if i ' m right , the president is a man .
if i ' m not right , the president is not a man .
logic doesn ' t make a statement about what happens .
i can say anything everything .
but the key thing is , if i ' m right , itlies .
so when klaus says there is no soul .
second , if he ' s right , he has no soul .
these things are logically correct .
and now our dective consciousness immediately feels , you can do something out of it .
it relies to a third sentence , which has nothing to do with the first two sentences at all , which pretends that the opposite of the first sentence is already proven and pred .
because actually , we had to prove whether there is the soul or not .
but with this logic that just uses that two sentences are logically correct , and a third one , which looks like it has something to do with it , so we can save our lifelies .
so , we pretend that it ' s actually impossible to live without live a soul .
and we ' re very happy about it .
we can continue these things in different examples .
in the present , or perhaps , we have a very modern example that fillsing the newspapers and over again .
so that you have to present another philosophical subject , a permanent burninger from philosophy .
this has to do with us going back to the fourth century .
there was a scholar named johannes buridanus , and that ' s the buridan elephant is named after .
the burvian elephant is a lion made of pure nature .
he doesn ' t have that soul . it
this is s such a natural thing .
and if you put that right in the middle between two identical hayons , it starves .
because he doesn ' t know which haystack to go first .
so he ' s right in the middle .
this is how the things come .
equal forces with opposite background dissolve each other .
nothing happens at all .
it only s only you get another example , so you immediately makes the a haystack bigger , it doesn ' t need reason and nothing to do .
it automatically runs for the right thought .
so if you have this idea that you ' re somehow being driven in nature ' re determined by the larger piles that immediately attract you , you quickly feel that there must be something like a free will . so .
and if we ' re here in frankfurt main , i remember the max planck institute for brain science .
there ' s a scholar called wolf singer , and he ' s sometimes said , wolf singer says , there ' s no freedom of freedom .
now we can create the second sentence again and we can say , if wolf singer is right , he doesn ' t have freedom of .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can now read in the newspaper almost every day is what you find in this third sentence .
it looks something like someone who doesn ' t have freedom of , can ' t be considered responsible for his actions and claims either , and so he ' s ineustable .
again , here you have it again .
in of all first , you had to prove if there was something like freedom .
but the logic of deception allows us to pretend that if the first sentence from the beginning is wrong , as if course have accept the opposite without evidence .
and now you can simply , if you want to do anything yourself , if you want to test anything yourself , and most importantly if you want to make people happy , practice that courage to lie .
for example , practice that for example , once you meet a person you can say , there ' s no predictions .
and please don ' t use the german word for predictions , which is prophet .
you can ' t call that , that would be a little politically inconsistent again .
say there are no predictions .
immediately you ' ll learn one which there are , of course , predictions for , you can ' t prove that .
and you have a problem . and
because while you ' re busy finding realize that you can ' t prove that there ' s no predictions , the man is very happy .
he ' s very happy about it because he mistakeved her .
because he led them on a trip where he doesn ' t stay himself .
because actually , this person is not interested in evidence .
he ' s just interested in free himself from the need to prove that there are predictions .
so , in the way of shift in evidence , you see the impusificecity of lie .
and once you have a way to feel that point of sentence in other people , you do , because you will make others happy if you don ' t remember them of your self - lies in that way . and
thank you for your attention .
yes , good day .
i allowed i asked lilly if i to could mention her .
she ' s one of the organizers here from this great event , and she asked me if i wanted to give a talk here and present my idea .
i have to say honestly say , you got it , and it was hard for me talk about my idea . i .
and i may imagine introduce my island project that i ' m trying to imagine you .
but it , of course , is the sum of and lots of ideas .
i ' m probably going , the two nice girls are still there , i ' m probably among the generation that inspired created this bad eco image , because i ' ve started nine hundred studying engineering at karlnst , engineering college , today i think , kit .
and then i me to in the mid - 80s because i wanted to make renewables , and it didn ' t happen berlin in karl hall .
there was the nuclear research facility called leopoldsha .
they were all called k at the time , and the july was called kfa . they
these are called project carriers . these
because a good engineer either built great cars or built nuclear power plants .
but something stupid like a solar coin , which comes sort of a hundred watts out of the square meter , which was a toy .
and in berlin there was a crazy engineering collective .
i ' m graful to the premium kola person for him to rehabtru the word again , because after the wall fell , you couldn ' t use the wordmore , because everything on the left was bad .
however , that wasn ' t that in the eight -s .
and there was , there were self - organized alternative companies , and one of them was just sitting in kreuzberg in the lechenberghof where they were suspected of evil .
place of terrorism , but that was called cru technology , and it did wind and solar power , and that ' s i started in the mid - 80s .
and yes , a lot of what ' s been said today was very touched by me because there were lots , lots of beautiful expressions that i ' ve lived through .
i worked in the collective for 11 years , which was grassroots .
we were 20 people .
if one said no , the ortoprince , which totally crushed you down . i ' ve been 10 years , i ' ve been hard time tryinging for whether if i might really waste my great engineering college to a stupid thing , because all my father ' have always motivuaded him , you ' ve threw the money to the window with your child .
it ' s about nonsense .
and this was really very , very bitter , and you ' go into the a period , it just skip through an image where i asked myself after 10 years , a thousand d - mark were back then time then , basic wage , unity wage in the collective , of course , whether this should really be the great thing .
and i pause ended it to six and a half thousand , and then we got with friends , i became co - founder of the company solon , which then with the spin - off q cells became one of the world ' s cell companies . and
a huge success story , but again , of course , we have the problem of a growing company , and we have two thousand millionies , a small group , decided that we re start again and go back and address to the next issue of the future , and that is i think and our thinks , it ' s crazy again , that starts again with people saying , what ' s the nonsense , that ' not be possible , we ' re talking about storage . a the a , ' t done we ' re
and i brought you with a project that i want to imagine to you now .
and the title of the talk was , yes , how to get to a 100 percent renewables .
and we just started asking with a relatively simple crazy story , where could you use a memory meaningfully today ?
on this island , this is the island of graciosa on the arizonas .
yes , that ' s the data .
there are four and a half thousand people living there .
they have a 15 - percent renewable .
and the question is , why don ' t you have more anymore ?
it just can ' t technologically .
if you build more wind each other , the system starts to fail .
i ' m also always telling politicians when they visit facility in berlin court .
so they always say , why ?
we already have 20 percent in germany .
there can ' t be a problem at all .
but that ' s not true , we have seven percent in europe , and our web is physically the european . but
if we had 20 percent in europe , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , was two thousand2006 , started the first contacts with the island , just figure it .
how big ' s be a battery would be so that you could bring an island like this to 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe even eight percent renewable . ? . because
and yes , i ' ll go a another slide further again .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , about a hundred gigawatt of electric power is being built on the same in the world . and
that ' s the power of a hundred nuclear power plants , because it ' s particularly fast everywhere . that .
the world s energy starry that ' s happening is erasted with diesel , because you don ' t need permission . the .
this ' s quick . it .
you put a box like this .
and then it usually looks like this .
in always three of the trucks run , two are always waited .
yes , this ' s what that down there is the burden .
we also got very detailed data .
and the wind system , or the solar system , or whatever it is , is usually a back - up system or a system that can only be stored in small quantities here . and
our goal was just to say , okay .
the diesel becomes back - up and the wind , the sun use the load so they can represent the larger portion .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent of renewables , is energy per year , not power right now , you have to turn off the diesel off .
that is , at that moment , you need to make sure renewables can sort of take over the entire grid .
of course , they can only that if they ' re being kept here in some way .
nobody in the world has done that yet .
this is in a small scale , so you can also use your shaor in through a little alterr .
people always ask me , what are you actually researching in adlershof ?
that ' s what it goes done .
but if you want to break several of these circuitrs , and they ' supposed to build a network , it gets very complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to get to seven to nine percent renewables , and then here ' s the rest , the last rest , the last 10 , 20 percent renewables with , which is going to be very , very expensive , and that ' s not going to work , you make this out of batteries . and .
that is will definitely going to be an energy source that then know - hydrogen , methane , power to gas , or sh , that will be .
you have to go more go to a seasonal bath and winter - summer , not just day - night .
we just wanted to know what about a normal disnormal electrochemical battery .
how far do you even get ?
and then we did a whole lot of simulations .
and we the wind and the sun and the load simpedulated , and came to the result , a very exciting result that against the conventional system , which after 20 years , you takes a medium price of about 50 cents a kilowatt hour , you get out about four and a half cents . and .
these were the first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
if that ' s great , then we have a business model .
we ' re cheaper than as the diesel system , if the diesel price goes five percent a year .
and then we started negotiating with the insulaists .
what did everything have to be done ?
negotiated with investors , i ve looked looking for new societies .
we were only five people at time to rebuild one rebuild the society .
and here ' s the picture again .
the brown is sort of the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our system also has a price increase is because we do another 20 percent with them , and we don ' t miss a price increase to the other things .
and the power utility , which the power company on the island , has meant , we find that a great .
we also want to support , but we don ' t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin where we can sort of map the electrical ratio of the island on scale one to three .
that is , we looked looking to find the world ' s largest battery .
here she is .
it ' s naturally from asia , in this case from japan .
and funny thing , developed in the ' 70s it was developed at bbc mannheim , now bcb , and then licensedzed to the japanese .
it ' s you can see , it ' s a very , very large battery .
it has a megawatt power , and it can get that power for six hours , and that ' s the battery that we kind of simulation got out .
and then they set them up .
we ' ve also put one of these diesel aggregate the same size that it ' is there , into the hall , to actually sim the full dynamic behavior of this network , so in the hall now it looks like this , there the diesel , here ' s the big battery , here are all the circuits that we simulate the grid . we
over here , we simulate the whole transmission control system , the mile physics of the wires , to sort of map the vibration behavior on the grid .
and here you can s the whole thing again .
we can also turn two hundred kilowatts of solar on the grid .
here ' see again , here we see the diesel again , here again all the whole single sets .
and what we ' ve been done , for two thousand , the hall was then finished , to this today two thousand , almost everything that was done here between the single system of electronics , software we ' ve done .
so we ' re not battery manufacturers , we define oursel as a company that ' s only between the issue of battery and the issue of web and everything in between . so
you have to , communicate to the battery , you also to be able to communicate to the web , and it ' s very complicated .
the beauty is of the issue that on this island you basically anticip everything about the problems that we ' re going to get if we want to increase our share of renewables .
so this whole discussion , what ' s going back and forth right now , energy power , as should go , on the island , have , for example , for five and a half to 30 percent excess energy , so we ' re tire mud tearing the wind and the sun .
of course then offers smart grid .
so smart grid , a huge theme everywhere .
we can ve start integrating electricitypower , askinging around , you can manage the load .
that means , if you ' re seven percent renewable , you won ' t be able to do without memory . that
you can go through a smart grid , you can , through by building the nets , yes , you should definitely do that , listen to the portion , but you ' ll never be to avoid rid of memory . you
and that ' s a little bit of the message .
that ' s why a lot of people come in and look at this there just because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn off the diesel , you don ' t have this rotating mass that creates a certain amount of inertia on the grid .
and our european network grid is basically just of loud rotating masses of large power plants , where the wave is rotating all around europe .
we look in into this net , we see the 50 hertz , and when it gets nine and a - point nine hertz , we start a few valves , then a little bit of steam goes in again , then we get back up .
this is the system .
and of course , this is incredibly wearry .
if you tear that down somewhere , it takes a while .
the spinning reserve has at least 10 seconds to keep the web stable .
and in time , you can react to something elsely again .
if you don ' t have that anymore , this rotating mass , you have to replace that with power electronics and electrochemistry .
and we can turn out two milliseconds in this big battery .
and then you see the enormous speeds are .
and the message is , we need to avoid up on these rotating masses if we sort of achieve our goals 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 , 30 percent and so on , if we even want to do them .
then we have to break down our must - run capacity on the net .
must - run simply means the power station is works to keep the frequency .
yes , this ' s a huge debate right now , growing coal plants , because we don ' t use , or hospital , because that can ' t done .
and we ' re just trying to figure out that you can break down the capacity , the must - run capacity , by putting electrochemical storage into the grid . and
fortunately , there ' s a lot of studies on this right well .
and to for do that , people always come and look at our course on , like of our island test state .
and yes , the discussion is always about , how far can you take a little future ?
and a lot of the discussions i ' ve had in the last six years have been similar to the discussion i ' ve had in the last 30 years about solar .
isn can ' t matter , ' s insansens , ' play stuff , we calculated everything , never count . it
we have 30 gigawatt of solarvolta in germany today .
this is excellent .
and i just assume that in the next 30 years , we will ll have the same capacity of electrochemical storage all over the world .
very simply , this ' s how it will come .
there will be a whole lot of resistance and arguments .
the beauty thing is that i ' ve kind of seen now in the last two years that scientists are facing putting on my side .
we ' ve now got over 10 million funding projects now to now put a 10 megawatt battery onto the german grid .
this will happen next april .
so from then you also realize that there ' s a change there , and only from this barrier to yes , to the idea that a hundred percent renewables is right .
and if you have a hundred percent renewables , it ' s like an self - sustaining system .
so far debates always tried discussion , these insulars , doing self - sustaining , who have their own small network , because it has s nothing to do with our community .
the question is very simple , if you make completely independent of any fossil or uranium sources that are being drille out somewhere in the world and brought to you , you ' re an island .
then they only just use what ' s there the sun and the wind where they live .
and that ' s a little bit of our vision of wired energy supply , and i ' m also cradle to cradle that you saying , use solar energy .
and that ' s what we do , and that the , the talk premium kola , that you can be a collective again and use solar energy , a little bit together here . and
and yeah , i ' just like to encourage you in the sense that you can be a little crazy and also have a vision . and .
and you really have to stay quite tough doing this , but i think it ' s done . and
thank you .
when steve lopez , los angeles timesist , walked in the streets in the center of los angeles one day , he heard a wonderful music .
it came from a man , an african - american , syhy , rough , homeless , playing on a violin that had only had two strings .
many of you will know the story , because from steve ' s article about this became a book that was movieed again later with robert downey junior as steve lopez and jamie foxx as nathaniel anthony ayers , the violinist who studied at juilliard conservatory and his promising career tragically was ended early on by his paranoid schizophrenia . this was ended
nathaniel left juilliard , suffered a mental breakdown , and 30 years later , he lived as a homeless on the streets of skid row in the downtown los angeles .
i recommend all to reading steve ' s book or look at the movie , so that you can understand not only understand the wonderful connection that had come between these two men , but also how the music helped that connection , and how it was the instrument , when this word is allowed to get nathaniel away out of the street . i steve s or i
i met mr . ayers in 2008 , two years ago , at the walt disney concert hall .
he had just heard a performance of beethoven ' s first and fourth symphony , and he came behind the stage to imagine me .
he spoke in a very happy and curty tone about yo - yo ma and hillary clinton and how the dodgers would never make it to the baseball world series , and all of all because of the cheky passage of the first violin in the last sentence of beethoven ' s fourth symphony .
we came to about music , and a few days later , i got an email saying that nathaniel was interested in violin lessons .
i have to mention that nathaniel refused a medical treatment , because he had already been treated with electrosh shocks andne and handcuffs , a trauma that followed him his whole life .
as a result , he ' s now particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic events - , - which are sometimes so bad , and he for days disappears days , walking around in the streets of skid row , always exposed to this horror and torture of his own mind .
and in a sti setting was nathaniel was when we started our first lesson at walt disney concert hall , he had this crazy flickering in his eyes and he was completely lost . and
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and how someone wanted to poison him in sleep .
i was afraid , not my myself , but i was afraid that i could lose him , that he could sink into one of his states , and that i could destroy his relationship to the violin if when i started talking about scale and ars and other exciting forms of educational violin .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven ' s violin concert .
and as i was playing , i realized that in nathaniel ' s eyes , a complete change was happen on .
it was like was standing under the effect of an invisible drug , a chemical reaction whose catalyst was my game . it
nathaniel ' s manic anger turned into understanding , into a calm curiosity and grace .
and like a miracle , he took his violin and started playing some portions of violin concerts and then asked me to play it : mendel ' s , mozakv , siberia . and
we then started talking about music , from bach to beethoven , brahms , schubertler and all the other bs , from bartok to esas .
and i realized that not only did he have an encyclopedia knowledge about music , but he also connected a close personal relationship with her .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that i otherwise only know from my colleagues at the philharmonic of los angeles .
by playing music and talking about music , had come from this paranoid , confused man who had just moved in the streets of los angeles , had become a loving , educated , brilliant , musician in juilliard .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music means mental health .
because music allows him to transform his thoughts and delusions using his imagination and creativity into something real .
and so he escape of his agonizing states .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
that ' s why we make music : so that we can create something that is inside all of us , deep inside us , shape our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity reality . that and
and the reality of that expression comes reaches all of us , and moves , inspired and united states us .
so what nathaniel struck brought the music brought him back to a community of friends .
the decruptive power of music brought him back to a family of musicians who understood him , who recognized his talent and paid careed him .
and i ' m keep playing with nathaniel , whether at walt disney concert hall or skid row , because he reminds me why i became a musician .
thank you . thank
bruno giughini : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i fortunaly stolene the cellist .
i hope you will forgive me .
so i ' ve knew a lot of fish in my life .
i only loved two .
this first one , was more like a passionate affair .
it was a beautiful fish , delity , good texture , richful , a best - sellingr on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , it was grown in aquaculture on the supposedly highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel comfortable selling it .
i had a relationship with for several months with this beauty .
one day , the head of the company called and asked if i could speak at an event about the sustainability of the farm .
" of course , " i said .
here was a company that was trying to solve what become this unimaginable problem for our chefs . how do we keep fish on our menus ?
in the last 50 years , we ' ve been fished the oceans how we ' ve cut forests .
it ' s hard to overestimate the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish , one we love , the tunas , the strawberryfish , the salmon , the swordfish , they ' ve collapsed .
there ' s almost nothing left .
so probably guly , or evil aquaculture , fish engineering , going will be part of our future . so
a lot of arguments against it . fish farm conta pollute the environment , most of them anyway , and they ' re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a 15 to one food rate .
that means 15 pounds of wild fish is are needed to get a pound of breeding tuna .
not very sustainable .
it doesn ' t taste very well either .
so here , finally , a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
the day before the event , i called the head of public for the company .
let ' s call him don . let .
" don , " i said , " just to get the facts right , you ' re famous for growing so far out in the ocean that you don ' t contaute the environment . "
" that ' s true , " he said . " we ' re so far out there that the waste is distributed from our fish , not concentrated . "
and then he added , " we ' re basically a own world . and
that food score from 2 . 5 to 1 , " he said .
" the best in the industry . "
2 . 5 to one , great .
" 2 . 5 to one what ? what are you feeding ? "
" sustainable proteins , " he said .
" great , " i said . i set up .
and that evening , i was lying in bed thinking , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day , just before the event , i called don .
i said , " don , what example are sustainable proteins ? "
he said he didn ' t know . he ' s going to ask .
well , i talked to a few people in the company . nobody one could give me a properent answer until i finally talked to the senior biologist .
let ' s call him don as well .
" don , " i said , " for example , are sustainable proteins ? "
well , he mentioned some algae and some fish flts , and then he said , chicken pellets .
i said , " chicken pellets ? "
he said , " yes , feathers , skin , bone flour , remains , dried and processed for food . "
i said , " how much percent of your food is chicken ? "
think maybe two percent .
" well , that ' s about 30 percent , " he said .
i said , " don , what ' s sustainable about feeding chickens to fish ? "
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , " there ' s just too many chicken in the world . "
i fell in love with this fish .
no , not because i ' m a self - righteous enjoy and a good man .
i am .
no , i actually fell in love with this fish because i swear to god who tasted fish for chicken after this conversation .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love story .
it ' s the romantic way , the way in which the better you know your fish , you love the fish the more .
i first eat ate it in a restaurant in southern spain .
a friend journalist who had been talking about this fish for a long time .
it kind of mixed us up .
he came to the table with a bright , almost glowing white color .
the chef had soldd him .
stop twice .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
who can make a fish taste so well after it ' s sold ?
i can ' t , but this guy can .
let ' s call him miguel . in fact , he s called miguel . it .
and no , he didn ' t cook the fish , and he ' s not a chef , at least in the way that you and i understand under it . and
he ' s a biologist at veta la palma .
this is a fish breeding in the southeast corner of spain .
it ' s near the mouth of the guadalvir river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argentinean .
they growing carnts on which was basically wetlands .
they did that by irriga watering the land .
they built this complicated series of canals , and they pushed water out of the country and out into the river .
well , they couldn ' t make this work , not economically .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
it killed about 90 percent of the birds , which is a lot of birds in this place .
and so in 1982 , a spanish environmental awareness company bought the country .
what did you do ?
they ' ve reversed the flow of water .
they literally changed the lever .
instead of pushng the water out , they used the canals to pull the water back in .
they floodd the canals .
they created an 11 , 000 - hectare fish farm - barsfish , seaba , shrimp , aal - and in miguel and his company have completely reversed ecological destruction . they
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you ' ve never seen anything like this before .
they stare out at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see is flooded channels and this dense , lush march .
i was there not a long time ago with miguel .
he ' s an incredible guy , three pieces of charles darwin and one part " a crocodile to kiss . "
okay ? there we were , fighting through the wetlands , and i ' m shaing and sweating , i have mud up to my knees , and miguel is quiet giving a biology lecture quiet .
here he high highlightsing a rare loron . here
now he mentions the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
and here , here he sees a pattern of clusters that reminds him of the tanzanian giraffe .
it turns out that miguel spent most of his career in the mikummi national park in africa .
i asked him how he became such a fish expert .
he said , " fish ? i don ' t know anything about fish .
i ' m an expert in relationships . "
and then he goes and falls into more talks about rare birds and algae and weird water plants .
and don ' t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community was unging , like that .
it ' s great , but i was in love .
and my head got weak about this delicious piece of delicious fish that i had the earlier .
so i inter pauserupted it . i said , " juan , how come your fish taste so good ? "
he pointed at the algae .
" i know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that ' s incredible . "
but what do your fish eat ?
what ' s the food score ? "
well , he goes to tell me that it ' s such a rich system that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
the vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , that ' s what feed the fish .
the system is so healthy , it ' s completely self - cont .
there ' s no food .
ever heard of a farm that doesn ' t feed your animals ?
later the day , i was drove around on this site with juan , and i asked him , i said , " for a place that seems to so natural , " unlike any farm i ' d ever been on , " how do you succeed ? "
at that moment , it was like a film filmmaker had asked a stage change on .
and we turned around the corner , and we offered the most incredible view , thousands and thousands of pink flamingos , a literally pink carpet as far as the eye is .
" that ' s success , " he said .
" look at your belly , pink .
they . "
swimming ? i was completely confused .
i said , " juan , don ' t you drag your fish ? "
" yes , " he said .
" we ' re losing 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to the birds .
now , last year , were 600 , 000 birds on this site , more than 250 different species .
it ' s become the largest and one of the most important private bird reserves in all europe . it
i said , " juan , isn ' a well - thving bird of birds the last thing you want to have on a fish farm ? "
he shook his head , no .
he said , " we ' re building efficiently , not intensely .
this is an ecological network .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the pinker the belly , the better the system . "
okay , let ' s retk this : a farm that doesn ' t feed their animals and a farm that measures their success in the health of their predators .
a fish breeding , but also a bird reserve .
oh , and by the way , these flamingos shouldn shouldn ' t even be there in the beginning .
they breed in a city 240 kilometers away where the soil quality is better for nest maintenance .
every morning they fly 240 miles to the farm .
and every evening they fly 180 miles .
they do that because they can follow the striped white line of the highway a2 .
seriously .
i had imagined a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at juan .
i said , " juan , do you fly 240 kilometers to the farm and then do you fly 240 miles back at the night ?
do you do that for the kids ? "
he looked at me like i had just quoted a song from whitney houston .
he said , " no . they do that because food is better . "
i didn ' t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don ' t like a fish skin . i don ' t like it spafill . i don ' t like it cruisp .
it ' s this bitter , boiged taste .
i almost never cook with it .
and yet , when i tried it in this restaurant in southern spain , she didn ' t taste it for fish meat at all .
it tasted sweet and pure like taking a little bit off the ocean .
i mentioned this to miguel , and he was noddind .
he said , " the skin looks like a sponge .
it ' s the last defense before something enters the body .
it ' s evolved throughout over evolution to suck up impities . "
and then he said , " but our water has no inses . "
okay . a farm that doesn ' t feed your fish . a farm that measures their success the success of their predators .
and then i realized , when he says , a farm that has no polles , he under tremenouslysiz it , because the water that flows through this farm comes out from the river guadalvir river .
it ' s a flow that carries all the things that rivers today tend to carry , chemical pollutants , waste of pest control .
and when it fought through the system and that leaves , the water is s cleaner than as it came in .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm that doesn ' t feed your animals , not just a farm that measures their success on the health of their predators , but a farm that is literally a water treatment facility , and not just for these fish , but also for you and me . so .
because when the water flows out , it sinporas in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i ' ll take it , and you should do that too , because this love story , however romantic , is also insight .
you might say it ' s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we ' re talking about barsch or meatts .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , one where food actually tastes good .
but for a lot of people , that ' s a little too radical .
we ' re not realists , we ' re enjoys . we are re lovers .
we love farmers ' markets . we love small family businesses . we talk about local food . we eat organic .
and if you say that these are the things that assure the future of good food , somebody sits somewhere and says , " hey guys , i love pink flamingos , but how are you to feed the world ? "
how are they going to feed the world ? "
can i be honest ?
i don ' t like that question . i
no , not because we already produce enough calories to feed the world more than .
a billion people will starve today .
a billion - that ' s more than ever before - because of massive inequalities in distribution , not total production .
now , i don ' t like this question because it ' s determined the logic of our food system over the last 50 years .
feed grains on plant eaters , pest protections on monopolies , chemicals to the earth , chickens to fish , and all the time the farm industry has simply asked , " if we feed more people cheaper , how awful can that be ? " ? "
that was the reason . it was reason . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a business in development , a industry that quickly cut ecological capital that allows that particular production .
this is not a business , and it ' s not agriculture .
our grain chamber is threatened today , not because of declining demand , but because of declining resources .
not through the latest meal and tractors inventions , but through fertile land , not through pumps , but through fresh water , not through chains , but through forests , and not through fishing boats and nets , but through fish in the sea .
you want to feed the world ?
let ' s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better yet , how can we create conditions that empower any community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don ' t look at the agribusiness model for the future .
it ' s really old , and it ' s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are on top it , and it s never produced anything something really good for food .
instead , let ' s look at the ecological model .
this is the one that goes back to two billion years of work experience . this
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
businesses that aren ' t worlds for themselves , businesses that are rebuilding instead of debutng , businesses that grow intensively instead of intensely , farmers that aren ' not just producers , but experts for relationships .
because they ' re the ones who are also experts on taste .
and if i ' m really honest , you ' re a better chef than i ' ll ever be . and
you know , i ' m right to me , because if that ' s the future of good food , it will be delicious .
thank you . thank
if i want to give you one thing to today is that the total of the data that we consume is greater than the sum of its parts , and instead of thinking about information processing information , i want you to think about how we can use information so that patterns emerge , and we see recognize trends that wouldn not have been visible . today what is that if what recognize want that
so , what we see here is a typical death diagram of age .
the program that i use here is a little experiment .
it ' s called pivot , and what i can do with pivot is , after a certain cause of death , i can filter , say , accidents .
and immediately i see a another pattern that comes out . and
and that ' s because in the middle section here , people are most active , and they ' re the most deli over here . that
we can take a step further and then rearrange the data and see that cardiocular disease and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
now as if we move on and rank age , we say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are actually the main cause people should worryed about .
and if you can see the research , is this especially true for men .
so you realize that the look at information and data looks very much like of swimming in a living information graph .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not for content themselves ?
what we have here now is the covers of every single sports illustrated that has ever been printed .
it ' s all here . it ' s all online . it
you can like to test it after i my talk in your rooms .
with pivot , you can dive in a decade .
you can dive in a particular year .
you can jump directly to a particular copy .
now when i look here , i see the athletes who appear in this article and the athletes .
i ' m a warren armstrong fan , so i click here , and show me all the posts in which warren armstrong is mentioned . i
now , if i just want to get a rougher overview , i think , " ok , what if i look at everything about " bicycle ? "
so i ' m going to take a step back and expand the perspective .
now i see greg lemond .
and so you get an idea of that if you search kind information , targeted , widerer , zoom in , zoom out , you don ' t looking for or you ' re not just surfing . and
you do something that ' s actually a little different .
it ' s something in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
now i want to go this idea a little bit further with something a little crazy .
what we ' ve done here is we ' ve took every single wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a small summary .
the summary contains a brief preview and a symbol of the area that it comes from .
i ' m just showing the top 500 of the most popular wikipedia sites .
but even in this narrow view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the topics that are most popular on wikipedia .
now i ' m going to choose the issue of government .
now , after i elected government , " i realize that the wikipedia categories that are most covered with that are time magazines are " people of the year . "
this is really important , because this is an insight that ' s not in a single wikipedia page .
that ' s only notice if you step back and look at the whole thing .
looking at a particular of these summaries , i can then go into the time magazine , " people of the year , " and see everybody together .
now when i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of them are government officials ; some come from science ; some , even less , come from the business . here ' s my boss , and one comes from the music sector . now
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
so now we can jump and look at all the ted prize winners .
you can see , we ' re surfing the web for the first time as if it ' s really a web , not just from side to side , but much more abstract . you .
and so i want to show you something else that might be a little surprise . and
i ' m just showing you the new york times website .
pivot , this application - i don ' t want to call it a browser ; it ' s not really not a browser , but you can look at websites with it - and we bring this zoom technology to every single website like this .
so i can take a step back and jump directly to a specific section .
this is important because only by looking at websites in this way , you can look at all the entire internet line in the same way . so
so i can zoom in into my path in a particular time frame .
here ' s the state of the entire demonstration that i ' ve kept here .
and i can sort of bring back everything i ' ve looked at today back .
and if i go back step back out and look at everything , i can rearrange my course perhaps to my search past . here , i ' m looking for " nepotisally , for bing , or live labs pivot .
and from here , i can go in into the page and call it back .
it ' s a metaphor that ' s used over and over again , and every time it makes the picture bigger than the sum of the data bits . it .
right now , in this world , we think data is a curse .
we ' re talking about the curse of flow information .
we ' re talking about " drowning into information . "
what if we could turn this situation and turn the internet on its head , so that instead of always going from one to another , we begin to go a lot of things to a lot of things , and recognize patterns that would have otherwise been hidden ? what ? what
if we can do that , then this previous - data trap will perhaps become a new source of meaningful information .
and instead of just moving in information , we can get knowledge from it .
and if we learn knowledge , maybe we can even draw wisdom out of it .
so ' s i stop , thank you very much .
i grew up with a certain portion of science fiction .
in i was high school , i went to school bus , every an hour a hour .
and my nose was always in a book , a science fiction book that kidnapped my thoughts into other worlds , and satisfied my deep , unbeapecting curiosity .
this curiosity also expressed showed revealed that every i wasn ' t in school , i was walking through the forests , and collecting " samples , " , collecting frogs and snakes and beetles and pond water , bringing everything home and looking under the microscope . this . and this . this
i was totally science interested , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and explore the limits of the possible .
and my love of science fiction seemed to reflect reflected in my environment , because back then , in the late ' 60s , we flew to the moon and studied the deep sea . and
jacques cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows that showed us animals and places and a world of wonder that we could never imagined before .
that ' s probably done pretty well to that this science fiction role .
and i was an artist . and .
i could draw . i could paint .
and because there were no video games or this overht of computer - generated movies or all the imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we all had to at the time . when we read a book as children kids , we took the description of the author and we projected it onto the canvas in our heads .
my reaction to that was drawing and painting of aliens , alien worlds , robots , spaceships and all so like that .
in math class , i was constantly caught by the teacher hiding behind my textbook , paintng around .
creativity had to get out somehow .
and something interesting happened , because what fascinated me about jacques cousteau ' s shows was the idea of a completely unknown world here on ours earth .
i certainly , i ' d never reach an alien world with a spaceship , that seemed pretty unlikely to me .
but here was a world that i could actually enter , here on earth , and it was as fascinating and exotic as anything i had always imagined when i had read these books .
so i , when i was 15 , i decided to become diver . so
the only problem with this was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1 , 000 miles away from the nearest ocean .
but i didn ' t let myself free myself by that .
i annoyed my father until he finally discovered found a diving school in nashville , new york , right on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my dive in a ymca in the middle of the winter in nashville , new york . i .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i ' t get the ocean two years later when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years that have now gone , i ' ve spent about 3 , 000 hours underwater , 500 hours of it in submersibles . since
and i ' ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the shallowter oceans , is as rich of fascinating life as we can ' t even imagine . and
nature ' s imagination has no boundaries , as opposed to our own misely human imagination .
to this day , i feel deepest awe of what i see on my dives .
and my love of the ocean continues with the same intensity as ever .
when i entered a profession as an adult , it was filmmaking .
that seemed the best way to combine my inner urge to tell stories , with my need to create images .
as a child , i kept drawing comic books and so on . as
so films were the way to bring images and stories together . that fit together .
of course , the stories i picked myself were from the science fiction world : " terminator , " aliens , " and " abyss . "
in " abyss " i could connect my preference for the underwater world and diving with filmmaking .
so my two passionstwund .
something interesting happened in " abyss " : to solve a story problem in this film - which that is that we had to create a kind of liquid water system this - we went back to computer - generated animation , cg .
what came out was the first computer - generated soft - surface figure ever seen in a movie .
now the film didn ' t raise any money , in fact , it was just playing its cost , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was like hypnotized by the magic that was coming out of it . the
according to arthur clarke ' s law , obvious course , advanced technology and magic are no longer different .
so they saw something magical .
and i found that was incredibly exciting .
and i thought , " wow , that needs has to be involved into in the film art . "
so we went on to " terminator 2 , " my next movie , further . so
together with ivm , we created the liquid metal guy , and the success was all on how this effect would happen .
and it worked . again , we had created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we ' ve already played a little more money with the movie .
from these two experiences , a whole new world was reached , a whole new world of creativity for movie - producers .
so i started a company along with my good friend stan winston , who was at that time was the best makeup and creature designer at time , it was called digital domain .
the basic idea of this company was to skip the period of analog processes with optical printers and so on and start with digital production .
and then we did that , and we gave us a competitive advantage for a while .
but in the mid - 1990s , we realized that in creature and character design - which we actually started the company for - we were too slowly forward .
i had written this piece " avatar , " which was would push the measurement table visual effects and computer - generated effects into whole new heights , with realistic human , expressive characters made using cg , and the main characters should all be cg , and the world should be cg .
but the measuring sheet presse it back , and the people in my company told me that we were not able to do this .
so i moved that around , and i made this other film about the big ship that ' s going missing .
i sold this as " romeo and juliet on a ship , " it became a love movie of epic scale , a passionate movie .
but secretly i actually wanted to dive down to the real wreck of the titanic . but
that ' s why i made the film .
that ' s the truth . but the studio didn ' t know . that
but i convinced them by saying , " we ' re diving to the wreck . we ' re going to film the real wreck . but
we ' re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
that ' s incredibly important . it ' s a good starting for marketing . "
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but that goes back to the fact that your imagination can create a reality .
we then we actually created , six months later , created a reality in where i found myself in a russian submersible , four miles below the surface of the north atlantic , looking at the real titanic through a bullhead .
this wasn ' t a movie , t a hd movie , this was real .
so , that really blew my mind .
and the preparation for this was enormous . we had to build cameras and headlights and all kinds of things .
and i noticed how much these deep - sea dives , like a space mission looked .
well , they were also high - tech , and they needed a lot of planning .
you get into this capsule , then youoat down into this dark , hostile environment , where there is no hope for rescue if you can ' t make get it back yourself .
and i thought , " wow , that ' s just like being in a science fiction movie .
that ' s really cool . "
i was really obsessed with exploring the deep sea . i
anyway in the part that has to do with curiosity and science - it was everything . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn could t give me .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could then create a visual effect for , but i couldn ' t imagine what i would see outside the window .
in some of the following expeditions , i ' ve seen creatures in thermal sources , and sometimes things that i ' d never seen before , sometimes things that no one had ever seen before and that science we saw them had not found words for the time saw seen . d never
so that really threw me right , and i wanted more .
and so then i made a slightly unusual decision .
after the success of " titanic , " i said to myself , " okay , i want to lay my day job as a filmmaker hollywood , and become a full - time researcher for a while . "
and then we started , we dived to the eagle , and we explore it with robotic vehicles .
we went back to the titanic .
we took little robots that we built that hold off a fiberglassd .
our purpose was to dive in and look at the inside of the ship which had never been done before .
no one had ever explored the inside of the wreck . you haven ' t have any means to do it yet , so we developed the technology we needed .
well there i am sitting now , on the deck of the titanic , in a submersible , seeing planks that are pretty similar to these boards here and i know the band used to played there .
and i fly with a little robot vehicle through the hallway of the ship .
now i ' m actually using it , but my consciousness is inside the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically in the shipwreck of the titanic .
this was the most surreal form of a deja - vu that i ' ve ever experienced , because before i turned around a corner each time , i always knew what was going to appear in the light bu of the vehicle , because i had walked across the movie set for months when we made the movie .
because the set was a precise copy of the blueprints of the ship .
so this was a very strange experience .
she made me realize this telepresence experience that you can use such robotic avatars and you move your consciousness into the vehicle , into this other form of existence . she
it was really incredibly profound .
and maybe a little glimpse at what might happen in a few decades if you have cyborg bodies to explore something or do other things in all sort kinds of post - human future scenario that i can think of as a science fiction fan .
after these expeditions , we really began to appreciate what we ' d seen down there , for , these deep - sea sources , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . these are basica of aliens , but here on earth .
they live with chemosynthesis .
they don ' t exist in a sunlight - based system as we do that .
and so you see animals are lying right next to a 500 degreesrade that they can survive there . and
at the same time , i was also very interested in space science , which was again the science fiction influence i of my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and who are to deal with nasa and are sitting at nasa expert bureau and planning real space missions , they re going to russia , they go through the biomedical protocol and everything and everything , then go to the international space station and take our 3d camera systems . and . and so then going
that was fascinating .
but in the , it turned out with that i took space scientists into the deep sea with us .
i took them me and i made them access to the world down there : astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the sources so they could look around , take samples and test instruments and so on .
we made documentaries , but we actually did science , in fact space science .
so the circle went between my existence as a science fiction fan , back as a child , and implementing into reality . so
in the course of this voyage , i learned a lot .
i ' ve learned a lot about science , but i now i think a director must be able to lead , be a leader like a ship captain or something .
but i didn ' t understand know much about leadership before i joined these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say to myself , " what am i doing here ? because ?
why do i do that ? what ' s going coming out ? "
these stuly movies don ' t make us money .
we ' re playing the cost of production . , no trace from fame .
everybody thinks i ' d run away between " titanic " and " avatar , " and ' d fired my nails on a towel somewhere on the beach .
i made all these films , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what do you do doing ?
you do it for the task , for the challenge - and the ocean is the most challenging environment that exists . you do it because of the exploration rush , and because of the strange connection that comes creates when a small group of people creates a team .
because we did all of this with just 10 to 12 people who worked working for years continuouslynter , and sometimes we were sea two to three months in a row .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the responsibility you have each other , because you ' ve done a task you can ' t explain any anyone else .
when you come back to the land and you say to yourself , " we had to do it - the fiberglass , the sound slow , and all the around it , all the technology , and the difficulties , the human performance when you work on sea , " you just can ' t explain other . it ' s like police or soldiers who have gone through something together and know that they can never explain to anybody . and never explain never explain .
there ' s a connection , a mutual respect .
so when i came back to make my next film , " avatar , " i tried to apply the same leadership , which is that you respect your team and deserve respect in each return . so . so
that really changed the dynamic changed .
so there i stood was back with a little team on unknown terrain , and we created " avatar " with a new technology that had didn ' never existed before . so
incredibly exciting .
a tremendous challenge .
and we became real for a four and a half year years a real family .
so my way of making films changed completely .
there were people who thought we really done these ocean system and transported sent it to the planet pandora .
for me , it was more of a fundamental way of doing my job , the actual process that changed in the result .
so what can we make from all this ?
what lessons did we learn learned ?
i think first of all is curiosity .
it ' s the most powerful human feature .
our imagination is a force that can even create reality .
and your team your team ' s attention is more important than all laurels in the world .
i comes to young filmmakers and say , " give me a advice how to do this . "
and i say , " don ' t restmit yourself .
others have for you . don ' t do it to yourself , don ' t bet against yourself . take risks on yourself . "
nasa has a favorite sentence : " failure is not an alternative . "
but in art and in exploration , failure has to be an alternative , because that ' s it guarantees a trust .
no important effort that required innovation was ever taken without risk .
you have to be prepared to take those risks .
that ' s the idea i ' d like to leave you with . failure is an alternative , but fear is not . thank you .
today i ' m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
and this may might surprise something thing , because my full - time work at the foundation is all about vaccines and seeds , the things we need to invent and deliver the to make the 2 billion a better life the poorest . and . and
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , actually more important than everyone else person on the planet . but
climate change means that their seeds don won ' t grow over many years ; we rain too much or too little ; things will to change as way as their fragile environment cannot .
this it leads to faminevation . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , climate change is going to be terrible for you .
and the energy price for them is very important .
in fact , that if you could only reduce the price from one thing to poverty reduce , energy would be far the most effective .
well , the energy price has fallen over time .
in fact , the progress society is based on energy progress .
the kohler revolution pushed the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in electricity , and that ' s why we have refrigerators , air conditioners , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we ' re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price - let ' s cut the price - we meet a new barrier , and that barrier is related to co2 . but
co2 heats up the planet , and the equation for co2 is actually pretty clear .
they addply the co2 released which leads to temperature change , and that temperature change has some very negative effects : effects of the weather , and perhaps worse , the indirect consequence that the natural ecosystems cannot adapt these rapid changes and so collapse whole systems collapse . they . they the
now , the exact relationship between a co2 increase and the temperature change in temperature and where the other consequences are , there are some ambiguities , but not very many .
and there ' s certainly ambiguity about how bad these will going , but they ' re going to be extremely bad !
i asked the top scientists several times , " do we really need to get down to near zero ?
isn ' t enough half or a quarter ? "
the answer is , until we get to zero , the temperature will continue to increase .
that ' s why it ' s a big challenge .
it ' s very different from saying , we have a three - foot truck that has to go under a three - foot bridge , and you can kindueeze underth it .
this has to go down to zero .
well , we emit a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons .
every american is about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it ' s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and somehow we need to create changes that reduce that to zero .
it ' s been up long .
only different economic changes have actually influenced it , and we need to go from rapid growth to reduction and to reduction to zero .
this equation has four factors : a little bit of multiplication . you have this thing on the left - co2 - that you want to move towards zero , and that will depend on the number of people , the services every human uses on average , the average energy for every service and co2 ' emitted per unit of energy .
so let ' s look at every factor individually and think about how we get that to zero .
probably one of these numbers has to be very close to zero . probably
now this is basic algebra , but let ' s go do it .
first , we have the population .
today 6 . 8 billion people live .
and it apps to nine billion . move to nine billion .
if we ' re very successful with new vaccines , health care and reproductive medicine , we might probably going to reduce that by 10 percent to 15 percent , but right now we ' re seeing a 1 . 3 percent . if
the second factor is the services that we use .
that includes everything , the food that we eat , clothing , television , heating .
these are very good things , and poverty reduction means making these services available almost to everyone on the planet .
it ' s great that this number go up . it
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could probably make compromised and use less , but on average , that number will increase every year , so therefore it will more than double , the number of services that are provided per person .
this we see a very fundamental service . is there light at home so you can read your homework ?
and these students don ' t have it , so they go out and read their schoolwork under the streetlight . and
now , with efficiency , the e , the energy per service , finally there ' s good news .
we have something that doesn ' t go up .
because of different successes in the light sector , through other car , through new techniques in construction , there are a lot of services whose energy use , some individual services are be reduced by 90 percent .
in other services , like making fertilizers , 105 : 00 : 05 : 56 , 000 - & gt ; 00 : 05 : 58 , 000 , or air traffic or air traffic , the area for improvements is much smaller . in
in total , if we ' re optimistic , maybe we might get a reduction by a factor three or maybe even a factor six .
but in the first three factors , we ' ve gone from 26 billion to maybe very least 13 billion tons , and that ' s just not enough . but
so let ' s look at the fourth factor - and this is going to be a key factor - that is the amount of co2 that being emi per unit of energy . so
the question is , can you get that to zero ?
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every manufacturing method electricity today emits co2 today , except renewables and nuclear energy .
so , what we need to do at a global level is create a new system .
we need energy wonder .
now when i use the term " wonder , " i don ' t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and its services are a miracle .
people here have helped development a lot of these wonders .
usually there ' s no deadline that you need a miracle to a certain date .
normally you ' re basically just standing wrong and some come , some others don ' t .
but in this case , we have to give full - blow and get a miracle in very short time . but
well , i wondered , how can i really get this across ?
is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that sparks people ' s imagination here ?
i remember last year when i brought mosquitos , and somehow people like that .
the idea became really tangible for you , you know , there are people who live with mosquitoes .
for energy , i came up this .
i decided that releaseing fireflies would be my year - contribution to the environment .
so here are some natural fireflies .
i was told that they don ' t bite , in fact , they ' re not even going to leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of game solution like this , but they don ' t bring much .
we need solutions , either one or several , that have an unimaginable scalealing and unimaginable reliability , and even though there are many directions where people are looking for it , i really see only five that can meet these big demands .
i ' ve left tides , geothermal , fusion and biofuels .
these they may make a moderate contribution , and if they do better than i expect , that would be great , but my core statement here is that we need to work on all these five , and we can ' t give up any of them because they intimidate us , because they all have significant problems . they . and
let ' s first look at burning of fossil fuels , burning of either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there may seem be simple , but it ' s not . you have to catch all the co2 that comes out of the chimney after burn , put under pressure and then store somewhere and hope it will stay there . it .
there are some pilot projects that are do this at a 60 percent to 80 percent level , but getting it at 100 percent will be very difficult , and getting a deal for carbon2 is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is storage time question . there .
who ' s going to make it ? .
who can guarantee something that is literally many billion times larger than any kind of waste you can imagine from nuclear and other things ?
that ' s a lot of volume .
so that ' s a tough nut .
next , nuclear energy .
it also has three big problems . the cost , especially in highly regulatedulated countries , is high . the question of security that you really feel that nothing can go wrong despite human participation that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it ' s not very big , there ' s a lot of concerns . because
so three very difficult problems that may be solvable , and that ' s why you should to work on .
i ' verized the last three five .
it ' s renewables , as they ' re often called .
and they also have - although it ' s great that they don ' t need fuel - they have some downsides .
one is that the energy density that these technologies are generate is dramatically lower than power plants .
these are energy farms , you ' talking about lots square kilometers , a thousand times more area than a normal power station . these
and also , these sources are interruptions .
the sun doesn ' t shine all day , it doesn ' t shine every day , and the wind doesn ' t blow all the time . the
so , if you depend on these sources , you have to have a way to get the energy in times when it ' s not available .
so there are big price options here . there are challenges in transmission . so for example , if we say that the energy source is outside of the country , not don ' do t you need the technology , you also have to deal with the risk that the energy coming from where else .
and there ' s the storage problem .
and to you the dimension , i looked at all sorts of batteries that are being made : the for cars , computers , cell phones , flashlights , for everything . and i compared that to the amount of electronic energy the world uses , and i found that all the batteries that we produce now could store less than 10 minutes of the total energy . and . and the
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that will be a factor 100 better than the approaches right now . so
that ' s not impossible , but it ' s not that easy . it .
this is what happens when you try to bring these interrupted sources about say , 20 percent to 30 percent of the use . this
if you want to support 100 percent it , you need an incredible wonder battery .
now , where should we go : what is the right approach ?
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the there ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on this . hundreds .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
many of people will say , they ' re crazy ! that ' s good .
i think in the ted group there are many here who are already engaged in there .
bill klein has several companies , including one called esolar , which has great solar technologies .
vinod khosla invests in dozens of companies doing great things and have interesting opportunities , and i ' m trying to support that .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company that , perhaps surprisingly , pursue the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the nuclear barrier : modular , liquid .
the development stopped in this industry a while ago , so it ' s not a big surprise that some good concepts are around .
the terrapower concept means that instead of a part of the uranium , the one percent , the u235 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u238 .
that ' s a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you ' d been thinking about for a long time , but you could never reasonably simulate if whether it would work , but since there ' s modern supercomputers , you can simulate it and see that , yes ! with the right materials approach , it looks it works . but . been in thinking about for
and because you burn that 99 percent , the cost profile is much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can actually use the waste from today ' s reactors as a fuel .
instead of breaking your off about it , you just burn it . it ' a great thing .
the uranium is useded , a little bit like a candle .
you can see that it ' s a kind of a column , often called as the " traveling wave reactor . "
that really solves the fuel problem .
here ' s a picture of a place in kentucky .
that ' s the waste , s 99 percent . you took out the part that ' s burned today , so it ' s called expled uranium .
that ' s what the u . s . did for hundreds of years .
and if you filter oceanwater cheaply and easily , you get enough fuel for the rest of the life of the planet . and
you know , there are a lot of challenges , but it ' s an example of a lots of hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let ' s think about how to should measure our success .
what should our testimony look like ?
well , let ' s go to the goal that we need to achieve , and then we ' s talk about the intermediate step .
many talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 . many
it ' s really important that we get there .
the rest 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still some agriculture . hopefully forest degradation and cement will be clean until then .
so in order to get those 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like china , have completely change their power generation .
the other note is whether we use the zero emissions technology , whether it ' s used in all the developed countries , and we ' re on our way to get it to the rest .
that ' s really important .
this becomes a key element of this evidence .
if we go back from there , what should the 2020 evidence look like ?
it should contain the two elements again . it
we should use the efficiency measures to make reduce along the way , and the less we emit , the less the co2 sum will be , and therefore the temperature . we
but in fact , this note for the things that we do that don ' t completely lead to the big reductions is just the same , or even a little less important as the other one , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs . but
we have to these breakthrough with full - gas , and we can measure that in corporate records , in pilot and regulations changes .
there are a lot of great books on this topic . there
the al gore book , " we have a choice , " and david mckay ' s " sustainable energy without the hot air . "
they really do through it , and they create a framework in which this can be debated widely , because we need from all sides to support .
there ' s a lot that needs to come together .
that ' s a wish .
a very specific wish that we invent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose that wish , which is , half energy without carbon is invented . i took that wish .
this one has the biggest impact .
if we don ' t get that wish , the rift between long term and short - term people will become terrible between the united states and china , between poor and rich countries , and almost all the lives of these two billion will be much worse . if .
so what do we need to do ? so
what actions am i asking for ?
we need to stand for more research funding .
when countries meet in places like cows , they shouldn ' t just talk about co2 .
they should discuss this innovation strategy , and they were shocked by the ridiculousls few funds spent on these innovative approaches .
we need market incentives , co2 taxes , cap & amp ; trade , something that creates a price signal .
we need to spread the message .
we need to lead dialogue more rational and more complete and also the things that are done by the government . we
it ' s an important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you . thank
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand terrapower a little bit better - first of all , can you give us an idea of the scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all the big scientists what we ' ve done , we only need a few 10 million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure it works reasonably , you ' re only in the 100 million . do
the hard step is to build the first reactor , find another billion , the regularities and the place that actually builds the first of them .
once the first one is done when it runs the way as it promised , everything is very clear , because the efficiency , the energy density is as different from nuclear energy as we know it .
to get understand this , that means building deep into the ground almost like a vertical column of nuclear fuel , that conized uranium , and then the process starts up and down ?
bg : exactly . today you have to re - fill the reactor , so there ' s a lot of people and a lot of controls that can go wrong , this thing where you open it up and put things in or out . that ' s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years - think of a column - that bury it without all the complexity . but
and it ' s sitting there burning for 60 years , and then it ' s done .
a nuclear reactor that provides a solution to the waste .
bg : yeah . well , what happens to the garbage : you can let it sit - there ' s a lot less garbage with this method - then you take it and you put it into the next reactor and you burn it .
and we start by taking the waste that already exists that ' s in these coolriges or dry tankss in the reactors . that ' s our launch fuel .
so what was a problem for these reactors is what we fill in our , and that dramatically reducing the waste volume of waste during this process . so
but as they ' ve been talking to different people in the world about these possibilities . while
where is the greatest interest in doing this ?
bg : now we haven ' t setd down in a place , yet , there ' s a lot of interesting open rules to everything called the nuclear . there ' s a lot of interest , and the people of the company were in russia , india , china - i was here and i talk met the minister of energy and talked about how this fits the energy agency .
i ' m optimistic . you know , the french and the japanese have done something in that direction .
this is a version of a thing that was made .
this is an important step forward , but it ' s like a fast reactor , and some countries built these , so anyone who ' s implemented a fast reactor is a candidate for our first one .
in your mind , time frame and probability of really bring something ?
bg : now we need one of these scalable , electricity - generating things that ' s very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to use .
this is sort of the deadline that the environmental models that we need to put in .
and , you know , terrapower , if everything is going well , and that ' s a big wish , it could be it easy . and
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds that , just if their approaches work , the funding for their pilots , can contribute it . and
and it would be best if you could do multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
in terms of the big possible breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing you know ?
bg : an energy collapse is the most important thing .
it would have been without the environmental challenge , but that makes it so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don ' t know their work as well as this , but there ' s the modular method , which is a different approach .
there ' s a liquid type of reactor that seems a little difficult , but maybe they say that about us .
and so there are different , but the beauty of this is that a an uranium molecule has a million times as much energy as , say , a carbon dioole , and that therefore ' s why you can deal with the problems , and they ' re mostly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , plays the potential , which the impact on the country and other things , almost in their own league . and that and an the
if that doesn ' t work , then what does it do ?
do we need to implement emergency procedures to try to keep the earth ' s temperature stable ?
bg : when you get into this situation , it ' s like you ' ve eat too much and you ' re standing in face of a heart attack . then what do you do ? you might need a heart surgery or something .
there ' s a research field called geoengineering , which deals various techniques to delay warming , so that we could get 20 or 30 years longer to walk together .
this is just a insurance method .
you hope we don ' t need that .
some people say you shouldn ' t just work on insurance at all , because that might make you lazy so you keep eating , because you know that you ' s going to save the heart surgery .
i don ' t know if that ' s smart when you look at the importance of this problem , but there ' s a debate in geoengering about whether you should have this available , if things get faster , or this innovation takes longer than we expect .
climate changeists : do you have one or two sentences for those to convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
do you say there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds that move things around ?
there are very , very few things you can even say , that there is a chance in a million .
the main problem here is like aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay it a lot later .
and so the idea is , now that you have all sorts of urgent problems to invest in something that you only have about later - and the that the investment isn ' t that clear . in fact , the ipcc report isn t necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world looking at ipcc and saying , okay , that ' s not a big drama .
the fact is that this uncertainty should worry .
but my dream here is that if you can do it economiclly , and while at the same time eliminate co2 , the skeptics say , " okay , i don ' t care that it doesn ' t emi release co2 , i almost wish it did it , but i ' m probably going to accept it because it ' s cheaper than the previous method . " . " but accept do it
and that would be your answer to the stefan sagn argument that if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals suffer that , the poverty reduction , fight malaria and so on , that there it ' s a stupid waste of resources to in spendvest money on it while there are better things we can do . and money it and
bg : well , the actual spending research - let ' s say the u . s . should spend 10 billion a year more than they do today - that ' s not that dramatic .
things shouldn ' t suffer among others .
you then you get to huge amounts of money , and here reasonable people can disagree if you have something that ' s not economic and you try to finance it . for me , most the waste is going on .
unless you ' re very close to a cost drop and you ' re just funding the learning curve , i think we should try more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
if the fraction you get is a very high energy price , then only the rich can compete up . if .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much on our energy without changing their lifestyle .
but for the bottom two billion , it ' s a disaster .
and even stefanborg is thinking around .
his new chain is , " why isn ' t the research more being discussed anymore ? "
he ' s still associated , his earlier stories , with the skeptic camp of his previous stories , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and that ' s why he ' s bringing the research argument . he
and that ' s a thought process that i think is appropriate .
the research , it ' s just crazy , how little that ' s supported .
bill , i think i ' m talking to almost all the people here when i say , i really hope your wish will be true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , at ted , peter skillman presented a design competition called " the marshmallow challenge . "
the idea is quite simple . four - four teams have to build the largest free - story structure with 20 spaghetti , about a meter tape , about a meter and a marshmallow . the .
the marshmallow has to be on top it .
and even though it seems really simple , it ' s actually really hard because it pushges people to work together very quickly .
and so i thought this is was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design workshop .
it was a huge success .
since then , i ' ve done about 70 workshops around the world , with students , developers and architects , even with ctos of the fortune 50 companies , and there ' s something about this task that gives deep insights into the nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of them with you . since
usually most people start oriented themselves on about the task .
they talk about it , they think about what it ' s going to look like , they ' re reg raging around power .
then they spend a little bit time in planning and organization . they sketch and lay out spaghetti .
they spend a lot of their time in building growing structures .
and finally , just before you don ' t have time , someone takes the marshmallow and you gent put it on the top , step back and " ta - da ! admire your work . and
but what happens , almost always , is that the ta - da becomes a " uh - oh " because the weight of the marshmallow causes the whole thing to bend and collapse . but
there are a number of people who have a lot more " uh - oh " moments than others , and among the worst are new bwl students .
they lie , they cheat , they ' re confused , and they produce really miserable things .
and of course , there are also teams that have a lot more ta - da structures , and among the best are fresh students from kindergarten .
and that ' s pretty amazing .
as peter told us , they not only produce the highest towers , but they also produce the most interesting structures of all . and
what you might be ask is , how is this happening ? why ? what about them ?
and peter says , " none of the kids spend time being head of the spaghetti gmb . "
they don ' t spend time in power battles .
but there ' s another reason .
and that is that bwl students were trained to find the right plan , ok !
and then realize it .
then what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don ' t have time , and what happens ? and
it ' s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what kindergarten kids do different is start with the marshmallow and building prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so they have the ability to repair rusty prototypes . what
design constructists recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of an inceratal process .
and with each attempt , the kids get direct feedback about what works and what doesn ' t . and
so the performance of working with prototypes is important - but let ' s see how different teams act .
the averagelihood for most of them is about 50 feet , b students do half of it , lawyers do a little more , but not much , kindergarten kids are better than adults .
who ' s most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
1 meter is the highest i ' ve seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and self - reinforcing geometric patterns are the key to building stable structures .
ceos are a little over average . but this here is where it gets interesting .
if you have an executive administrator on the team , they get significantly better .
it ' s incredible . you look around and you see , " this team will going win . "
you can predict that . why is this happening ?
because they have special skills for process leadership .
you lead the process , you understand it .
and that team that controls and payss to the work will significantly improve the performance of the team .
specialized skills and process skills and combination lead to success .
if you have 10 teams that do typical , you get about six that have stable structures .
now i tried something interesting .
i thought , let ' s do the poker shot the .
so i offered a 1 , 000 - prize of software for the winners .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anybody had built a two - inch construction , he they would have carried the price home .
so isn ' t it interesting that high athletes have a strong effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
so what do you think happened ?
now they understood the advantage of prototyping .
so from the same , bad team became one of the best .
they produced the highest construction at the least time .
so there are deepound lessons for us about the nature of drive and success .
you might ask , why would someone actually spend time creating a marshmallow challenge ?
the reason is that i ' m create digital tools and processes to help teams create cars , video games and visual effects .
and what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps identify hidden assumptions .
because frankly , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge provides a shared experience , a shared language , or a basic attitude , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this such simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in it can go visit marshmallow switch . com .
it ' s a blog where you see how to build the marshmallows .
there ' s a step - by - step instructions there .
you find crazy examples from all over the world of how people optimize and reffine the system .
there are also world records . there
and the basal lesson , i think , is that construction is actually a connectivetive sport .
it requires that we all focus our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking optimally , how our feelings and our actions in the challenge that we face . it .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all it takes to take us from a " uh - oh " to a " ta - da " moment . and
and that can make a big difference .
thank you . thank
let ' s pretend we have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool ted - like machine , and this is a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to go in .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you cannot ' stay in the present and now .
and i wonder what they would choose , because i ' ve often asked my friends this question lately , and they all wanted to go to the past .
i don ' t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there were cars or twitter or " america ' s seeking the superstar . "
i don ' t know . i
i ' m convinced that you ' re some of drawn to nostalgia , to thinking .
and i understand .
i ' m not part of this group , i have to say . i
i don ' t want to go to the past , and i don ' t because i ' m an adventurer .
it ' s because possibilities on this planet don ' not go back , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that ' s ever been on the planet , no matter what scale they ' re scale : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining disease rates . this
there was never been a time like this before .
my great - grandparents all died when they were 60 . my
my grandparents pushed that number to 70 .
my parents are 80 on feet .
so there ' should better be a nine at the beginning of my death .
but it ' s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . that ' s an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
they have re - shaped the demographics population of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
they ' re gone . they ' ve gone .
we beat them . boomop .
in the rich world , diseases that threaten millions of us just a generation ago , hardly .
diplosy , reds , childhood .
does any anyonebody anyone know what that is at ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are successes of the scientific method .
and in my view , the scientific way to try things is to see if it works , change it , if it doesn ' t , one of humanity ' s greatest achievements .
so that ' s the good news .
unfortunately , that ' s the whole good news , because there are a few other problems , and they ' ve been mentioned a lot .
and one of them is that despite all our achievements , a billion people in the world go bed hungry every day . and .
this number is rising , and it ' s going very fast , and that ' s embarrassing .
and not only that , we ' ve used our imagination to deeplyly deva destroy this world .
drinking water , arab land , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear , and soon , and if we don ' t get out of this chaos - we disappear .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think we .
i think it ' s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without raping the country they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn ' t destroy it at the same time .
i really believe that , and no , that ' s not a wish dream .
but this keeps me awake - one of the things that keeps me awake at night - we ' ve never needed scientific progress as we did , never before .
and we ' ve never been able to use it reasonably the way we can today .
we ' re on the verge of amazing , amazing events in many areas , and yet i really think that we have had to go hundreds , 300 years before enlightenment to find a time where we ' ve fought progress where we ' ve gone more hard these things on more fronts than are now . now . and , we
people suck themselves in their faith , and it ' s so tight that you can ' t liberate them .
not even the truth will libera them .
and listen , everybody has a right to their opinion ; even a right to their opinion to progress .
but you know what you ' re not have a right to ?
they have no right to their own facts . ' sorry , they don ' t .
and it took me a while to figure this out .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccines for the new yorker , a little article .
and i was amazedd to fight resistance , to resistance to what is ended up the most effective operation in health care in human history .
i didn ' t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote an article and i went on .
and soon after that , i wrote an article about genetically modifieded foods .
same thing , just bigger .
people were crazy .
so i also wrote an article about it , and i couldn ' t understand why people thought that was " franken food , " why they thought moving molecules around in a particular way rather of a random way was a concern in nature field .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept on .
i mean , i ' m a journalist .
we type , we pay in , we go to lunch , that ' s okay .
but these articles were worried about me , and i couldn ' t figure out why , and eventually i found out .
and that ' s because these fanaticks who made me crazy weren ' t fanatic at all .
these were careful people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that made me upset .
but then i thought , you know what , let ' s face it .
we ' re at a point where we don ' t have the same relationship with progress as we used to do .
we talk really talk about it .
we talk ironically about it with little slogans about " progress . "
okay , there are reasons for that , and i think we know what reasons these are .
we ' ve lost trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes science , and there ' s no reason why it shouldn ' t be that way .
you can just name some names , and people will ll understand .
chernobyl , bangladesh , the challenger , vioxx , weapons of mass destruction , the u . s . presidential election 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we thought were always right . so be skeptical .
ask questions , ask evidence , ask evidence .
take nothing for granted .
but here ' s the thing : if you get evidence , you have to adopt accept those evidence , and we ' re not good at that . but
and i can say that we now live in an epidemic of fear i ' ve never seen and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that associated the autism epidemic with measles , mumps , and red vaccine .
very frightening .
a lots of studies have been conducted to see if that was true .
lots of studies should be conducted ; that ' s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection at all .
it doesn ' t make any difference . it doesn ' t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what causes us to feel real . it
we don ' t believe in a bunch of documents from a government officer giving us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that was catastrophic .
catastrophic because of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine for measles drops .
this is scandal , and we should be ashamed . this
it ' s terrible .
what happened that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because does anybody have measles here ? because
did a single person in the audience ever seen anyone die of measles ?
it doesn ' t happen very often .
what doesn ' t happen in this country at all , but 160 , 000 times in the world last year .
that ' s a lot of deaths from measles , 20 per hour . that
but because that has ' t happened here , we can denplace it , and people like jenny mccarthy can walk around and preach messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like oprah and larry king live . but
and you can do that because they don ' t connect cause and correlation .
they don ' t understand that these things seem to the same , but they ' re almost never the same .
and this is something we need to learn , and very quickly . and
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he liberated us from one of humanity ' s worst prisons .
no fear , no pain , childo , puop , disappeared .
the guy in the middle isn ' t that much .
he ' s called paul abit .
he ' s just developed a rotavirus vaccine with some other people .
it can save the lives of 400 , 500 , 000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn ' t it ?
now that ' s good , except paul walking around and talking about vaccines and saying how valuable they are , and that people should just stop moing .
and he actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist . so
when paul speaks in a public interroga , he can ' t speak without armed guards .
he gets phone calls at home because people like to tell him they know where his kids go to school .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
i don ' t need to say that , but vaccines are essential .
if you leave them on , return the diseases back , terrible diseases , and that ' s happening right now .
we ' ve now mase meas in this country .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon kids will die again it again , because that ' s just a matter of numbers . and
and they ' re not just going to die of measles . and
what about childo ? let ' s take that . why not ?
a classmate of mine wrote me a few weeks ago and said her she think i ' m a little too sharp .
no one has ever said that before .
she wouldn ' t va raise her child against childo . noly way . she
fine .
why ? because we don ' t have childo . and you know what ?
we didn ' t have childo in this yesterday .
today , i don ' t know , maybe this morning somebody in lagos got on an airplane ' going to los angeles , right now he ' s over ohio .
and in a few hours , he ends up and rents a car , and he comes to long beach , and he ' s going to visit one of these fantastic ted dinner tonight . and .
and he doesn ' t know that he ' s infected with a paralyzing disease , and we don ' t know either , because that ' s how the world works now . and
this is the planet that we live on . don ' t pretend it ' s not .
we love to hold ourselves in lies . we love that .
did you take all your vitamins this morning ?
echinacea , a little antioxidant that helps you the jump .
i know they ' ve did that , because half of americans do it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cures , and it doesn ' t matter how often we find out that they ' re useless .
the data constantly proves this .
they darken their urine . they almost never do more .
that ' s okay , you ' like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand - we hate the pharmaceutical industry .
we hate a too strong government . we have no trust in the system .
and we shouldn ' t either . our healthcare system is bad .
it ' s cruel to millions of people .
it ' s absolutely amazingly cold and soul - dead to us who can afford . it
so we ' re walking running away front of it , and where are we going ?
we ' re running into the arms of the placebo industry .
that ' s great . i love the placebo industry .
but you know , that ' s really a serious issue , because this stuff is s crap , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
and i have all kinds of little props here .
none of these - gingko , cheating , echinacea , cheating , acai , i don ' t even know what that is , but we spend billions of dollars on it , it ' s fraud .
and you know what ? when i say that , people scream me and say , " what do does do you care ? let people do what they want . "
that ' s how you feel good . "
and you know what ? you ' re wrong .
because i don ' t care whether it ' s the minister of health who says , " well , i ' m not going to take the evidence of my experts on mammography , " or some cancer quad who wants to treat his patients with coffee .
when you go on this path where faith and magic replace evidence and science , you get to a place where you don ' t want to be .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
he killed 400 , 000 of his people because he insisted that red broh , parsbs and lemon are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know can slow the course of aids . he . he
hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country that worse than any other is hurtd by this disease .
please don ' t tell me that these things don have consequences .
they have them . they always have them .
now , the brainless epidemic that we ' re in right now is this absurd struggle between the advocates of genetically engineered food and the bio - elite .
this ' s an idioc debate . it has to stop .
it ' s a debate about words , about metaphor .
this is ideology , not science . this
everything we eat , every grain of rice , every branch of broli , every roseh , has been changed by people .
you know , there were no mandarins in paradise .
there were no cantaloupe melos .
there were no christmas trees . we did all this .
we ' ve done it in the last 11 , 000 years .
and some of them worked , and some of them didn ' t .
we got rid of something which that didn ' t work .
now we can do it more closely . and of course there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and this stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , extend their lives .
you don ' t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don ' t understand that .
we disject genetically engineered food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i hear all the time is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monopoliics , we don ' t want huge fields with one thing , that ' s wrong .
we don ' t want companies to patent life .
we don ' t want companies to own seeds .
and you know what my answer is to all of this is ?
yes , you ' re right . let ' s fix that .
it ' s true , we have a huge food problem , but that ' s not science .
that has nothing to do with science .
it ' s right , morality , patentwork . it
you know that science is not a company .
it ' s not a country . it
it ' s not even an idea ; it ' s a process .
it ' s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn ' t , but the idea that we shouldn ' t allow science to do their work because we ' re afraid is a real dead end , and it keeps millions of people from flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 , we ' re going to have 70 percent more to food than are right now . 70 percent . you
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
shamebarrassing . shamesing .
they need that , and we don ' t give it them .
and why ? genetically engineer food .
we don ' t want to encourage people to eat this rotted stuff , like maniou .
manioc is something that half a billion people eat .
it ' s kind of like a potato .
it ' s just a bunch of calories . it ' s bad .
it doesn ' t have nutrients , it doesn ' t have protein , and scientists are building all this in it right now . it
and then people could eat that and wouldn ' t get blind . and
you wouldn ' t starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn ' t be chez panisse , but it would be nice .
and all i can say about this is , why do we fight this ?
i mean , let ' s ask ourselves , why do we fight this ?
because don ' t want to move genes around ?
it ' s not about pushing genes around . it ' s not about chemicals .
it ' s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our perseistennce on greater food , better food , unique food .
it ' s not about rice krispies ; it ' s about keeping people alive , and it ' s going to be a time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don ' t do that , if we keep on going as it , we be guilty of something i think we don ' t want to be guilty of , high - tech colonialism . if
there ' s no other description of what ' s happening here .
it ' s selfish , it ' s ugly , it ' s worthy , and we really need have to stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , " do you still want to go into this ridiculous time machine and into the future ? " so "
definit anyway . i definitely want to that .
right now , it ' s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time machine on anything we want .
we can move them where we want to move them , and we ' re going to move them where we want to .
we have to have these conversations , and we need to think about it , but if we get in into the time machine and go into the future , we ' ll be happy to have done that .
i know we can , and as far as i care do , that is something the world needs now . i .
thank you . thank
thank you .
for a while , i ' ve been interested in the placebo effect - it may seem strange that a magician is interested it this , unless you look at it like me , as " a deception that becomes something real thing if somebody believes firm enough in it . "
in other words , sugar pills in some studies have shown a measuresurable effect , the placebo effect , and that ' s because the person thinks what ' s happens to them is a pharmaceutical or a kind of . in pain management , for example , if the patient believes strong enough in it , there ' s a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect .
a deception becomes something real thing , because someone perves that way .
so , for us to understand each other , i want to show you a fundamental , very simple magic trick .
and i ' m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that ' s been at least in every magic book kids since the 1950s . and
i myself learned it from the cub scout magic of the trailfinder in the 1970s .
i ' m going to do it for you and then explain him . i
and then i ' m going to explain why i explain it .
so , look see what happens .
the knife you can study explore ; my hand you can study explore .
i ' m just going to hold the kn knife like in my fis like this . i
i push my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeve disa or comes out of it , i ' m just going to push my wrist right here .
in this way you can see that anything moves at no time . as long as i push here , nothing can travel in my sleeve or come out . in .
and the goal here is very simple .
i ' m going to open my hand , and hopefully if everything goes well , the knife is held by my mere physical magnetism .
it actually sits so hard in its place that i can shake it without the knife falling down .
nothing goes into my sleeve or comes out , no trickster , and you can study everything .
ta - da !
now , this is a trick that i often teach to little kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception if you look closely , even though it ' s a very simple - performing trick .
many of you in this room probably know this trick .
this way it works .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i ' m saying that i ' wrapped my wrist to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeve or comes out , and that ' s a lie . i .
the reason i hold my wrist is because it ' s the real secret of illusion .
because the moment that i turn my hand away from you , so you can see it from behind , this finger here , my thumb , just moves from where it was into a position where it ' s so stretch .
great trick ?
the back there is somebody who didn ' t have childhood .
so , he ' s here . exactly .
and when i turn around , the finger changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don ' t realize that are only three fingers down here : because the mind and the way he processes information doesn ' t count it individually , one , two , three , but sees it them as a group .
but that ' s actually what this is about . and then i open my hand . but
of course , it ' s held there , but not by through the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my thumb , who ' s now there now .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by turning back , is hidden by this movement , that the finger moving back again .
i take this hand away . and here ' s the knife .
you can do trick to your friends and neighbors this trick . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ?
a year ago or so ago , i read a study that really blew my mind .
i ' m not a doctor or a researcher , and that ' s why me was an amazing thing for me .
because what it turns out is that if you offer a placebo in the form of a white pill , in the form of an aminohalt pill , it ' s just a round white pill that has a certain measurable effect . because
but if you change the shape in which you give placebo , into a smaller pill , for example , and you change those blue colors and a letter on it , it ' s actually more measurably more effective . but
and that , even though none of these are any pharmaceutical - they ' re just sugar pills .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really knocked me freak out .
but it turns out that ' s not all .
if you take capsules , they ' re even more effective than pills of any shape .
a colored capsule , which is yellow and red at the other end , is better than a white capsule .
dose also a role .
one pill twice a day is not as good as three pills - i can ' t remember the exact statistic now . i ' m sorry .
but the key thing is .
. that the doses also matter a .
and the shape plays a role . and
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to reach the needle .
right ? a syringe with an ineonsctive - a few milligrams of an ineffective substance that you inject into a patient .
this creates a very strong picture in your head . it ' s much stronger than a white pill .
this graph is really - i ' ll show you another time if we have a projector .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn ' t work as good as the blue pill that doesn ' t work as good as a capsule that doesn ' t work as good as the needle . so
and none of this has some really pharmaceutical property . it ' s just our faith in it that is making a stronger impact in us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i going to take something that is obviously a deception , and i make it look real .
we know from this study that you have to reach the needle if it to go to it .
this is an 18 - inch hat needle . it ' s very , very sharp , and i ' m going to sterile it a little bit first .
this is really my meat . it ' s not damian ' s special grown meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
now i ' m going to put this needle in my skin and push through it until it comes out on the other side .
if you get sorry - if you fall easily aw easily - i showed this to a few friends in the hotel room last night and some people i didn ' t know , and a woman has become almost paralyzed . if
so i propose , if you get bad quickly , look away for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i ' m going to do the first hary part back here . so
you can see it in moment , but you can also look away if you want .
so , it goes like this , right here where my flesh starts , at the bottom part of my arm , i ' m just going to make a little snap .
i ' m really sorry . is you do that crazy ?
and now just out a little bit through my skin and out on the other side . and
now we ' re actually in the same situation that we had on the knife trick .
about .
but now you can ' t count my fingers , right ? but
so , i ' m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when they see that .
they say , " okay , i he ' s not that stupid and he ' clffng the skin just to talk to us for a few minutes . "
well , then i ' ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people in the back say , " okay . i didn ' t see that right . "
people in the backrooms are coming in .
let me show you from nearbyness .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
that ' s my meat , and i can turn it around .
i ' m sorry . if you get bad , look away , don ' t look back . i .
the people in the back or those people who see this on video later some point will say , " well , this looks pretty impressive , but if it was real , it would - see , here ' s a hole , and then , if it really real , it would be bleed . "
okay , let me sque out a little blood for you .
yes , here it is .
i would normally take the needle out now .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this context here , and intent to make something real out of deception , i ' m just going to leave the needle in there and go off the stage .
we ' re going to meet a few times in the next days .
i hope you ' re looking forward to it . thank you very much .
everybody talking about happiness these days .
i had some people the number of books that were published with " happiness " in the title in the last five years , and they gave up after about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there ' s a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there ' s a lot of happiness coaching .
everybody ' d like to make people happier .
but despite all this flood of work , there are several cognitive cases that make it , it almost impossible to think about happiness clearly .
and my talk today will be primarily based about these cognitive cases .
this is true for of professionals thinking about their own happiness , and it ' s true of scientists thinking about happiness , because it turns out we ' re just as mess as everyone else . this
the first of these cases is a resistance to admit complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply no longer a useful word , because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there ' s a certain meaning that we might narrow limit it to , but by and large , that ' s something that we ' re going to give up , and we ' re going have take the complicated perspective of what well - being is .
the second case is a confusion of experience and memory : basically it ' s between being happy in his life and being happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they ' re both thrown together in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the concentration illusion , and that ' s the unhafortunate fact that we can ' t think about a fact that affects well - being withouttorting its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there ' s just no way to get it right .
now , i ' d like to start with an example from someone who had a question and answer session after one of my lectures who told a story . [ unclear ] he said he had heard a symphony , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and at the end of the recording there was a terrible round noise . now the ,
and then he added , really quite emotionally , that ruined the whole experience .
but it didn ' t have that .
what it had ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of wonderful music .
they didn ' t pay because he was with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had gott to keep .
what this really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and about other people in the sense of two kinds of self . what .
there ' s an experience self that lives in the present and knows the present , is able to per experience the past , but basically only the present .
it ' s the experienced self that the doctor address - you know , when the doctor asks , " does it hurt now if i put it here ? "
and then there ' s a remember self , and the remember self is the one that leaves and keeps the story of our lives , and it ' s the one the doctor contactes by asking the question , " how have you felt lately ? "
or , " what was your journey to albania ? " or something like that .
these are two very different units , the experience self and the remember self , and conlatiing the two is part of the mess of the notion of happiness .
now , the remember self is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a fundamental response to our memories - it starts immediately .
we don ' t just tell stories when we go telling stories .
our memory tells us stories , which is what we can keep from our experiences is a story .
and let me start with an example .
there ' s an old study .
these are real patientsgoing a painful procedure .
i ' m not going to go into the details of it . it ' s no longer painful todaymore , but it was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to tell about their pain every 60 seconds .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they ' re asked , " who of these suffered more ? "
and that ' s a very simple question .
patient b clearly suffered more . his colon pressure was longer , and every minute of pain patient a had patient b , and more .
but now there ' s another question : " how much did these patients think they were suffering ? "
and here ' s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of colon rates than patient b .
the gut mirror stories were different , and because a very important part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories are is are very architectural or great - but one of them is clear .
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and the one that was worse was where the pain was the end at its peak at the end . it ' s a bad story .
how do we know ?
because we asked these people about their gut projection , and also much later , " how bad was the whole thing ? "
and she was much worse for a than for b in memory .
now , this is a direct conflict between the experience self and the remember self .
from the perspective of the experienced self , b clearly had a worse time .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually did clinical trials , and it ' s been done , and it works , you could actually extend the gut levels of patient a by just putting the tube in without stickping too much off it .
that ' s going to cause the patient to suffer , but only a little bit and a much less than it was before .
and if you do this that for a few minutes , you ' ve did the patient ' experience self to be worse off , and you ' ve done caused the patient ' s memory remembered self is much better off , because now you ' ve given patient a better story about his experience . and .
what does a story to ?
and that ' s true of the stories that memory gives us , and it ' s true of the stories that we invent . and
what a story isizes is changess , significant moments and ends .
ends are very , very important , and in this case the end dominated .
well , the experienced self lives his life continuously .
it has moments of experience , one after another .
and they say , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they ' re lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our lives - and i calculated that - you know , the psychological present is to about three seconds . what which means , you know , there are about 600 million of them in a life . there are about 600 , 000 . most of them don ' t leave traces .
most of you are completely ignored by the remember self .
and yet , you kind of get the sense that you should count , that what ' happens during these moments of experience is our lives .
it ' s the limited resource that we use while we ' re in the world .
and how we use them would seem to be important , but that ' s not the story that the memory self for us .
so we have the remember self and the experience self , and they ' re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is deal with time .
from the experienced self , if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first week , the two - week vacation is twice as good as the one week vacation .
that ' s not how it doesn ' t work for the memory self at all . that
for the remember self , a two - week vacation is hardly better than a one - week vacation , because there ' s no new memories .
they didn ' t change the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a memory self from an experienced self . time has very little impact on this story . and
now , the rememberning self does more than remembering and telling stories .
it ' s actually the one who makes decisions , because if you have a patient who had , say , two inte levels with two different surgeons and decides which to choose , the one who choose takes the one who has the memory , who ' s less bad , and that ' s the surgeon who ' s selected . , it have the a the
the experienced himself has no vote in that choice .
in fact , we don ' t choose between experiences . we choose between memories of .
and even when we think about the future , we don ' t usually think about our future as experiences .
we think about our future as predicted memories .
and basically you can think of this , you know , as a tyranny of the remember self , and you can think of the remember self as one that sort of drags the experienced self through experiences that the experience self doesn ' t need .
i feel that when we have vacation , which is very often the case , which is we do vacation largely in the service of the remember self .
and that ' s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we break from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations given for the dominance of the memory self .
and when i think about it , i think of a vacation we did a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i ' d ever had , and i think quite often about it in relation to how often i think about other vacations . and
and i ' ve probably followedd from my memories of this three - week journey , i ' ve been say for about 25 minutes in the last four years . and
now , if i ever opened the folder with the 600 images in it , i would have spent another hour .
well , that ' s three weeks , and that ' s only a hour and a half hours .
there seems to be a disputecy .
now , i may be a little extreme , you know , in how little i have for the breaking of memories , but even if you do more of them , there ' s a real question . why do we give memories so much weight in relation to the weight that we give experiences ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next vacation , you know that at the end of the vacation , all of your images are being wiped and you get an amnesiac drug , so you won ' t remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you to a different vacation , there ' s a conflict between your two types of self , and you have to think about how you decide this conflict , and that ' s really not obvious at all , because if you think in the sense of time , you get an answer . and if you think in the sense of memory , you could get a different answer .
why we choose the vacation that we choose is a problem that we face with a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two types of self capture two terms of happiness .
there actually are two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one for self .
so you can ask : how happy is the experience self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the experience self life ? and
and you ' re all - happiness for moment is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and by the way , we ' re now able to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experience self over time .
when you ask about the of remember self , it ' s a very different thing .
this is not about how happy a person lives .
it ' s about how happy or delighted the person is when that person is thinkings about their lives .
very different term .
anyone who doesn ' t distinguish these terms will screw up the study of happiness , and i ' m part of a lot of researchers on well - being who have long sced the study of happiness for long time in that same way .
the distinction between the experience self and the happiness remembering self has been recognized in the last few years , and now you ' re trying to measure the two separately .
the gallup organization has a worldwide survey where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in that direction .
so in the last few years , we ' ve started learning about the happiness of the two kinds of self .
and the main lesson that i think we ' ve learned is that they ' re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with their life , and it doesn ' t really teach a much about how happy he lives his life and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of correlation , the correlation is about . 5 .
what that means is , that if you met somebody and you would tell them , oh , his father ' is s a two - foot man , how much would you know about his height ?
now , you would know something about his size , but there ' s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
when i tell you that somebody put their life as eight on a scale of 10 , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experienced self .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about that determines the happiness of happiness itself .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness mostly means being happy with people we like , spending time with people we like .
there are other pleasures , but that ' s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of these two kinds of self , you ' re going end up doing very different things . so
the bottom line from what i said here is that we shouldn ' really think happiness as a replacement for well - being .
it ' s a completely different term .
now , briefly , another reason why we can ' t think about happiness is that we don ' t pay attention to the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , you ' re not going to get the right answer .
when you ask this question , you think that people in california have to be happier when they live , say , in ohio .
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , say , in climate . and
well , it turns out that climate isn ' t very important to the experience self , and it ' s not even very important to the thoughtful self that decides how happy people are .
now , because the thoughtable self is responsible , you can end up - some people could end up moving to california .
and it ' s kind of interesting to track what happens to people who moving to california in hoping to get happier .
well , your experienced self is not going to get happier . now
we know that . we .
but one thing ' s going to happen . you ' ll think you ' re happier , because when you think about it , you ' ll be reminded of how awful the weather was in ohio , and you ' re going to feel that you made the right decision . but . but
it ' s very hard to think about well - being clearly , and i hope i ' ve given you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you . thank
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you . thank
now , when we talked a few weeks ago , they mentioned to me that there was a pretty interesting result that came from this gallup survey .
is this something you can participate in because you have a few minutes left now ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
i think the most interesting result we found in the gallup poll is a number we absolutely didn ' t expected to find .
we found that in terms of the happiness of the experience self .
if we looked at how feelings vary with income .
and it turns out that under a 60 , 000 dollars a year , for americans , and that ' s a very large sample of americans , about 600 , 000 , but it ' s a big representative sample under a income of 600 , 000 dollars a year .
60 , 000 .
dk : 60 , 000 .
60 , 000 dollars a year people are unhappy , and they get less unhappypier as the poorer they get .
over that , we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean , i ' ve rarely seen such flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money doesn ' t give you experience happiness , but lack of money certainly causes you misery , and we can measure that misery very , very clearly . what
in the sense of the other self , the sense of the memory self , you get a different story .
the more money you earn , the hap you are .
it ' s not emotions .
but danny , all the entire american asp is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people took take this finding seriously , i mean , it seems to turn everything on its head , everything we believe , for example , in terms of tax policy and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country would generally take a evidence like this seriously and make on politics based on that ?
dk : you know , i think there ' s recognition for the role of happiness research in politics .
the recognition will slow in the united states , no question , but in the united k . it ' s happening right , and other countries it ' s happening right now .
people are about toknowzege that they should think about happiness when they think about politics .
it ' will going take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life rating , so we have to have this discussion pretty soon .
how you can increase happiness goes very differently depending on how you think and whether you think about the memory self , or whether you think about the experienced self .
that is going to change , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , they ' re designed to measure the ' s experience happiness .
that will , i think , part of the national statistics in the next or two .
well , it seems to me that this topic will become be , or should at least be the most interesting political debate to pursue over the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny kahneman .
i ' m jane mcgonigal . i create computer games .
i ' ve been developing online games for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality as it is to save in online games . i
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including all of you , to spend more time playing bigger and great games .
we currently spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
some of you may might think , " that ' s a lot of time for games . "
maybe a too much time when you think about how many problems we urge to solve in the real world .
but in fact , according to my research at the institute for the future , the exact opposite is exactly true . but
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solve the world ' s most desperate problems .
in fact , i am convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need tolly increase that time .
i calculated that the time is 21 billion hours of play per week .
now this may seem a little bit rereal first , so i ' ll repeat it so that it can work : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think we need to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to by the end of the next decade .
no , i ' m really serious .
why ? this picture explains pretty much precise why i think games are so essential to the survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait by the photographer phil toledano .
he wanted to capture the feelings while playing , so he set up a camera front of the players . he
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you ' re not a player , you some of the nuances in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , a little bit fear , but also intense focuss , very deepsed in solving a really difficult problem .
if you play too , you see some nuances here , the eyes raised and your mouth are a sign of optimism . the eyebrows are surprise . if
this is a player standing at the edge of what we call an epic victory . this
oh , you know that . ok . great . so we have some players here .
an epic victory is a result so extremely positive that they didn ' t know before it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and when you do it , you ' re shocked that you ' re actually able to do this . that ' s an epic victory .
this player is about of an epic victory .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces of problem solvers around the world as we tackle the barriers of the next century , the face of those who are against all oddsvers on the edge of an epic victory .
well , unfortunately , we see this face in real life when we face difficult problems .
i call it the " life i ' m bad " face , and it ' s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
that ' s me like make the " in life i ' m bad " face in .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph . d . why we ' re better in games than in real life .
this ' s a problem that a lot of players have .
we think that we ' re not as good in reality as in games .
and i don ' m not just talking less successful , even though that ' s part of it . and
we re getting more in game worlds . i mean well to motivation to doing something significant inspired to work with each other .
when we ' re in a game world , i think many of us are turning into our best version , anytime and immediately helpful to pers try to solve the problem as long as we need to try it after failure .
and in reality , when we fail , when we encounter obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel beaten . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or cynical .
we never have these feelings when we play games , they just don ' t exist in games .
and that ' s what i wanted to study as a ph . d . student .
why is it in games to think you couldn ' t just achieve anything ?
how can we translate these feelings from games into reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft , which provides the ideal environment for collaborative problem solving .
and i ' ve discovered some of things that make epic victories in online worlds possible .
so , first of all , when you get into one of these online games , especially in world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters who are willing to trust you a world - saving mission , immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly with your current level in the game , right ? but
so do that . so
you never get a problem you can ' t solve .
but always at the edge of your capabilities , so you have to struggle hard . but there ' s no unemployment in world of warcraft . but
you don ' t sit around you ' re turning thumbs . there ' s always something important to do .
and there are lots of employees . and
wherever they go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to finish their epic mission .
we don ' t have that simple that in real life , this feeling that when stick there are lots of employees ready .
also , there ' s this epic story , this inspiring story of why we ' re there and what we have to do .
then we get all this positive feedback .
you ' ve probably heard about " level high " and " + 1 strength , " or " plus - one intelligence . "
this constant feedback is not in real life .
when i leave this stage , i don ' t have : plus one and plus one crazy idea , plus 20 crazy idea .
i don ' t get that feedback in real life .
so , the problem of cooperative online worlds like world of warcraft is that it ' s so satisfying to stand on the brink of an epic battletime that we prefer to spend all our time in these game worlds . so
they ' re just better than reality .
to this day , all world of warcraft players have spent 5 . 93 million years solving the virtual problems of azeroth . and .
that ' s not necessarily something bad thing .
it may sound bad .
but to get see you in context , 5 . 93 million years ago , our first primate ancestors started walking upright .
so the first upright primate .
ok , so when we talk about how much time we spending playing games right now , it only makes sense when you think at time in terms of the scale of human development , which is extraordinary . so . so
but also appropriate because it turns out that by using all this time on play , we ' re actually changing what we can do as humans beings . but it
we develop into collaborative thinking , friendly beings .
that ' s the truth . ' s what i believe that .
look at this interesting statistic that was recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university : the average young person today in a country with strong play culture spends 10 , 000 hours playing online games by of the 21st age of age .
so 10 , 000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , 10 , 080 hours is the exact total time they spend in school , from fifth grade to end of high school - if you ' never missing .
so we have a whole parallel education where young people learn what it means to be a good player just like everything else they learn in school .
and maybe some of you have read the new book by malcolm gladwell , " fl airplane . "
so you know his theory of success , the theory of success 10 , 000 hours .
it ' s based on the great research in cognitive science that if we spend 10 , 000 hours trying to studying any subject to the 21st , we become masters in it .
we get so good at doing whatever it is as the most important people in the world .
so , what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are master players .
so the big question is , " what are players great at ? "
because if we could figure that out , we would have basically unprecedented human potential available before .
so many people we have in the world right now , spend at least an hour a day playing online games . so .
these are our master players . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at " something . "
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are extraordinarily good at whatever . and
if you haven ' t heard it . if .
the game industry is developing devices that save energy and work on mobile networks , rather than the broadband internet , so that players can play all over the world , especially in india , china , brazil online . the
you expect an another billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1 . 5 billion players in total .
so i started thinking about what it is , what these games make us master .
here are the four things i found . first of all , urgency optimism .
ok , think of it as extreme self - motivation .
urgency optimism is the desire to do something immediately , to overcome a hurdle , along with the believing that we have a reasonable hope for success .
players always believe that an epic victory is possible , and it ' s always worth trying , and it ' s the same .
players don ' t sit around .
playersrs are masters of spinning of dense social nets .
there ' s a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people more after we ' ve played with them , even if they ' ve defeated us .
the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play game somebody a with somebody .
we trust believe that someone spend time with us , that the rules are set , that we have the same goal and we stay until the play . we .
so interaction allows the growth of ties , trust and together other .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
happy productivity . fantastic !
you know , there ' s a reason why the average word of warcraft player plays 22 hours a week , kind of as a part - time job .
the reason is that when we play , we ' re actually happier to work hard than if we relax or do nothing .
we know that we workly as human beings when we do hard , important work .
and players are always willing to work hard when they get the right task . and .
and finally , epic meaning .
playersrs love to become part of awe of creating missions on a planetary scale .
here ' s a background to put this in light . you probably all know wikipedia , the world ' s largest wiki . here .
the second largest wiki in the world , with almost 80 , 000 entriess is the world of warcraft wiki .
five million people use it every month .
they ' ve collected more information about world of warcraft on the internet than they have about any other topic in any other wiki in the world .
they create an epic story .
they create an epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single result . players are super - powerful , hopeful individuals .
it ' s people who believe that , as individuals , can change the world .
and the only problem is you they think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real worlds .
that ' s the problem i ' m trying to solve .
edward castronova is a folk scientist .
his work is brilliant . he explores why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds .
and he says , " we ' re going to witnessing nothing less than a mass demoration in virtual worlds and online game environments . "
and this is from an economist . so he ' s logical .
and he says .
not like me - i develop games , i ' m a little bit overhauste .
so he says this actually makes sense , because players can achieve more in online worlds than in real life .
you can make stronger social ties in games than in real life . you get more feedback and rewards in games than in real life .
so , he says it ' s completely logical right now that players spend more time in the virtual world than they do in the real world .
i agree first , that ' s logical .
but it ' s definitely not an optimal situation .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event spanning back 2 , 500 years ago .
there are these ancient cubes made out of sheep ' ss . you know ?
before these fantastic game controllers , there had sheep shells .
and these were sort of the first games developed games by humans .
and if you ' re familiar with the work of the old greek historian herodot , you might know this story , the story of how and why games were invented .
according to herodotus , games , actually cube games , were invented in the kingdom of macedonia during a famine .
supposedly , there was such a great famine that the king of libya decided to a crazy idea .
people suffered . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so , according to herodot , they invented the cube game and they agreed a national strategy . one day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so immersed into the cube game , because games are so fascinating and surround us with satisfying , happy productivity that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then , the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat . and .
and according to herodot , they survived this famine for so 18 years by eating one day and playing the next day . and
just the same way , i think we ' re use games today . and
we use games to escape the suffering of the real world .
we use games to avoid everything that doesn ' t work in the real world , everything that is not satisfying in real life , and we get what we need out of the games .
but that doesn ' t have to be the end . but
this is the exciting thing .
according to herodotus , after 18 years , the famine didn ' t get better , so the king decided to perform a last cube game .
they divided the kingdom into two halves .
they played a cube game , and the winners got to end into an epic adventure . they .
they left libya and went looking for a new home , and they just left as many people as there was food to survive , and looking with the rest for an area where they could thrive . they
that sounds crazy , right ?
but recent dna evidence shows that the ancientruscans , who later formed the roman empire have the same dna as the old lyads . but
so scientists recently came to believe that herodotus ' " crazy story is actually true .
and geologists found evidence of a global cooling that took almost 20 years , which could explain the famine .
so this crazy story could true .
maybe they actually saved their people through play by diving into games for 18 years and then had that this intuition and learning so much about playing that they saved the entire civilization . maybe
so , we can .
we ' ve been playing warcraft since 1994 . we
this was the first strategy game in real time in the world of warcraft series . this was 16 years ago .
they ' ve played cube games for 18 years , we ' ve been playing warcraft for 16 years . they
i would argue say we ' re ready for our own epic game .
so , they sent half of their civilization looking for a new world , so i ' take my 21 billion game a week . so
we should agree that half of us spend an hour a day playing games until we solved the real world problems .
i know you ' re going to ask , " how do we solve real world in games ? " and that ' s exactly what i ' ve spent devoted my work at the institute of the future over the last few years . and
we have this flag in our office in palo alto , showing how we should understand the future .
we don ' t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best outcome , and then empower people to implement that idea into reality .
we imagine epic victories and give people the opportunity to achieve them .
i ' m going to show you very quickly three games that i designed to try and give people epic victories in their own future .
this is " world without oil . "
the game is from 2007 .
it ' s an online game where you have to overcome an oil scarcity .
the oil scarcity is invented , but we have enough online content to it become realistic for you and you actually live your real life without oil . so , when you get to play , they tell us where you live . and then you get news films in real time that show you how much oil costs , what there isn ' t available , how food is affected , how transportation is affected , whether schools are closed , whether there ' s riots . and you have to figure out how you make your real life if it was true . and we ask you to blog about it to put videos or photos . and you transportation is transportation , and we were true . to blog it you to you to put blog it . tell us where they you live the oil costs , ask you to blog it to put that show time
we ' ve tested this game with 1 , 700 players in 2007 , and we ' ve been accompanied it game over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
nobody wants to change their lives because it ' s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you ' re in an epic adventure and you ' re told , " we ' re run out of oil . " but
this is an amazing adventure going on .
figure out how they would survive . most of our players have kept the learned habits in the game .
so for the next world - saving game , we set a bigger , higher target than just oil scarcity .
we developed the game " superstruct " at the institute for the future .
the starting point is calcul a supercomputer that humans people have only have 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called the " global extinction sensitiization system , " of course .
the call to players to sign up almost like a " jerry bruckheimer " movie . "
you know jerry bruckheimer movies , where there ' s the dream team - they you have the astronaut , the scientist , the ex - straf , and just together they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say everyone ' s in the dream team , and our job is to create the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice . but
eight , 000 players played the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read when they google " superstruct . "
and the last game we bring out on march 3th . it ' s a game collaboration with the world bank . and
when you finish the game , you get the world bank the " social changers , ending in 2010 .
we work with universities all over sub - saharan africa and invite them to learn social transformation . we
we have a comic book on it . we have level up for local understanding , knowledge awareness , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i ' d like to invite of you to share this game with young people all over the world , especially in developing areas , who are benefiting from imagine their own social enterprises together to save the world . i
i ' m going to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven ' t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope you agree that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have all these superpowers , happy productivity , the ability to connect tight social networks , urgency optimism and the desire for epic significance .
i really hope that we play major games together to survive another century on this planet .
and i hope you ' ll design games and play with this .
if i forward into the next decade , i ' m sure about two things : that we can create any imaginable futureble , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let the world - changing games start !
thank you . thank
i ' d like to tell you something i noticed a few months ago when writing an article for italian wired .
i ' ve always touch my synonym dictionary writing , but i had already editing the text , and i noticed that i ' ve never looked in my life what the word " disabled " really means .
i ' ll read you the entry .
" disabled , " ad : " crushawoged , helpless , useless , destroyed , isolated , mutilated , wounded , treated , paralyzed , isolated , recoveredsis process , recover , impotented , copted , paralyzed , hand senile , old - ageair , driven pulled of traffic , repaired , done , broken , paid , injured , useless and weak . ,
antonyme : healthy , strong , powerfulive . "
i read this list loud to a friend , and i had to laugh first , it looked so ridiculous , but i only got to " guilty " and i couldn ' t say any , and i had to stop reading and first collect for this over flood of words and the emotional shock that came with it .
of course , this was a very , old synonym dictionary , and i just thought the copy must be pretty old .
but in fact , it was an copy on the early ' 80s when i was just starting elementary school and started to build and shape my outside of my family background , also in terms of other kids and the of the world around me . but
and thank god i didn ' t use a word dictionary at the time . and
if i took this entry seriously , i would have been born into a world that someone like me would see as a person whose life can ' t positive in any way , but today i ' m celebrated for the opportunities and adventures that i ' ve experienced .
so i immediately called up the online magazine and i expected to find a more appealing contribution here .
here ' s the current version of this entry .
unfortunately , it ' s not much better .
specifically , i 'd by the last two words me under " near antonym " whole " and " healthy . "
but it ' s not just about the words .
it ' s about what we think about the people we describe with these words .
it ' s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many ancient societies , including the greeks and the romans , have really believed that the hearing of a curse has a great force because what you ' say out loud can also manifest itself .
so , what do we really want to manifest - an disabled person or a powerful person ? so
just call calling a man eightless as a child could be enough to limit them and overpasse to ideas .
wouldn ' t it be beautiful to open doors ?
a person who opened doors to me was my pediatrician at the a . i . dupont institute in wilmington , delaware .
he ' s called dr . pizzoillo , an italo - american whose name , as you can imagine , most americans couldn ' t say correctly , so he was always called dr . p .
and dr . p . was always wearing very colorful flies , and was just simply designed working with kids for . and
i loved the time i spent in this hospital - except for my physical therapyrap .
i had to repeat individual exercises an infinite of times with these thick , elastic bands - in different colors - you know , to build my leg muscles , and i hated those bands more than anything else . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . an . an infinite of
and imagine i even negotiated with dr . p . as a five - old child , trying to stop these exercises , of course without success . and
and one day he watched me in one of my exercises - these exercises were just tiring and costless - and he said to me , " wow , aimee , you ' re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you ' re going to tear one of these bands one day .
and if you can do it , i ' ll give you a hundred dollars . "
this was , of course , was just a simple trick from dr . p . so could do the exercises that i didn ' t want to do , with the prospect of having getting the richest five - year - old girls be in the in the second floor , but he actually got me to see my daily practice horror with new eyes , so it became a new and promising experience . and
and i wonder today how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl shaped my self - image , and i could imagine seeing myself as naturally strong , powerful and athetic person . and . and
this is just one an example of a lot of how adults in power positions canmulate a child ' s imagination .
but as the quoted examples from the synonymous dictionaries prove , our language does not find room to imagine what something we would all wish want : allow each individual to see themselves as powerful people .
our language con carriess the social changes that in many cases have been caused by technological change .
from a medical standpoint , of course , you can say that my legs , the laser surgery for visually impairedment , knee replacement from titan and artificial hip replacements for aging bodies that allow people to really use all of their possibilities and move beyond the limits that their natural destiny set , not talk about social networking platforms , allow people to give their own identity , define themselves in their own way , and to orient global worldwide to groups that choose themselves .
so maybe this technological change makes more clear than ever that there s always a different truth , which is that every human in society can give something special and very powerful and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest option . so
the human ability to adapt - this ' s an interesting story , because people keep asking me and to tell how i deal with adversariness , and i ' m going to ask you something : this sentence never missed me , and i ' ve always felt very uncomfortable about answering people of people s questions about it , and i think gradually i understand why .
this sentence of dealing ills lives on the idea that success or happiness depends on dealing a challenge without being shaped by the experience with it , as if my life would been so successful because i could avoid the potential fall of a life with a prosthetic disability , or whatever people perceive me with my disability . this the this the
but the truth is that we are re changing . of course , we ' re shaped by the challenge , whether it ' s physical , emotional or even both .
and i ' m say that ' s good . and
ades are not a obstacle that we need to shift to better deal with our lives .
ads just belong part of our lives .
and i tend to see odds as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that it ' s very present , sometimes it ' s hardly seen , but it ' s with me all the time .
and i don ' t want to dis slow down the impact or the weight of the struggle a human .
there are ades in life and challenges in life , and they ' re just all real , and each person goes deals with it differently , but the question is not whether we deal with adties or not , but how we deal with it . there
so not only are we responsible for keeping the people we love from fates , but also prepare them to get deal well .
and we don ' t have a favor our kids when we make them feel like they can ' t adapt .
you have to clearly separate two things : one the medical fact that of being amputeed and two the social opinion about whether i ' m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and permanent disability i have to deal with is that the world always means it can describe me with these definitions .
in our desire to protect the people we care about and tell them the cold , hard truth about their medical prediction , or even provide a standard of quality of life that they expect , we need to ensure that we don ' t lay the basis for someone actually disabled .
maybe the current concept that s just looking attention to what ' s broken in you , and how we fix that , is a greater disability for individual than the pathology itself . maybe .
if we don ' t treat a human holistically , and we don t percei recognize all of its forces and capabilities , in addition to the natural struggle that you might need to lead , we create another disease . if
we reverseng a person who has value for our society .
so we have to look beyond patology and focus on all areas of human possibilities .
but most importantly , that between the perception of our inadefections and our great invention spirit , there ' s a connection .
we shouldn ' t or deny these challenge times , we shouldn ' t try to avoid them , nor should we put them under the carpet , but it ' s about seeingzing opportunities in the odds . we
i may might be more about finding sure that we don ' t have to overcome virtuementses , but that we ' re open to hug themg , grab them in the , and even use a fight expression and maybe even dance with them .
and maybe we can manage to see issues as something natural , coherent and useful and no feel so longer by .
this year , we celebrate the 200th anniversary of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my view , pointed out to something very true about human character .
i would describe it that this way : not the most powerful of his kind , and not the most intelligent of his kind , but the one who can best adapt to change . i
conflicts comes creativity .
not only we know from darwin ' s work , we know that the ability of man to survive and flourish is determined by the struggle of the human mind to change through conflict .
so , again , change and adaptation are human the greatest human skills beings .
and maybe we only know what wood we ' re made from of when we ' re really tested .
maybe that ' s the sense of ad , a sense of me , a sense of our own power .
we can give oursves something to ours this .
we can give a new meaning that goes beyond heavy times .
maybe we can see corruption as change .
poors are represent a change we haven ' t adapted to yet .
i think the biggest damage we ' ve done ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
honestly , who ' s normal ?
there ' s no normal . there
there ' s the usual . the typical , but not the normal . and would you want to know this poor gray person if they really existed ?
i think it ' rather not .
it would be great if we could exchange this paradigm of normality against another of possibilities or the strength to actually makete it a little bit more dangerous , so we can release the forces of a lot many children , and invite them to bring their very special and valuable skills into society .
anthrops have found that we have always challenged people from the members of our society : to be useful and to contribute .
there s evidence that 60 even 000 years the neanderthals carried older people and people with severe physical injuries ago , and that may happen because the life experience of people battle for these people was worth for society .
they didn ' t think these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i to in the city i grew up in to a grocery store in this red zone in northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing there in front of a baton of tomatoesto .
it was summer , and i had shorts on .
and i hear a guy behind me saying , " well , that ' s not aimee mullins . "
and i turn around and i see this older man . i had no idea who he was .
and i said , " sorry , sir , do we know ? i can ' t remember you . "
and he said , " well , you should couldn barely remember me .
when i first saw her , i took her out of her mother ' s belly . "
oh , so this one .
and of course , it made a click .
this was dr . kean , a man i only knew from my mother stories about this day , because of course , typical , i came late to my birthday two weeks . this .
my mother pranata diagnostic doctor was on vacation , and so my parents didn ' know the man who gave me at all .
and because i was born without thibs , and my feet had turned after them , and i had only a few toes on this foot and a few toes on the other foot , he was the transporter , this stranger had to send the bad news . and
he said to me , " i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and would never be as active as other kids , or that you could never live an independent life , and since then they just loved me . "
what really extraordinary me was that he collected newspaper clips of my entire childhood , whether i ' d won at a spelling competition in second grade , whether i was with the pathmen on the parade for halloween , whether i ' d won my scholarship or one of my athletic victories , and he used these clipss to teach his students , medical students from hahnemann medical school and hershey medical school . , hir , and
and he called this part of his course the x factor , the potential of human will .
you just ' t emphasize enough how critical this factor can be for human quality of life .
and dr . kean on said , he said , " i ' learned that kids , if they don ' t say something else all the time , and even if they only get a little bit of support if you leave kids themselves , kids can do a lot . "
you see , dr . kean changed his thinking .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone deals with it , are two different things .
and i ' ve also changed my thinking over time , if you asked me at the age of 15 if i had foolve my prostheses against legs of flesh and bone , i wouldn ' t delayed a second .
i really wanted to look normal at the time .
if you ask me that today , i ' m not sure .
and this is happened because i ' ve experienced something with my legs and not despite those experiences .
and maybe this change could also happen because i ' ve met so many people who have opened doors instead of encounter people who wanted limit me or wanted to fit an idea . and
see , it really takes one person to demonstrate you how to manifest your forces , and you ' re through .
if you allow someone to activate their own inner forces - the human mind is so safe - if you do that , and you open a door at a crucial moment , they ' re a very good teacher for these people .
they teach them to open doors to themselves .
the real meaning of the word " educationcate " is root in the word " education . "
it means producing something that is in you , the potentialck .
again , what potential do we want to access now ?
in the 1960s in a u k . , a case study done , and then time high schools were turned into whole schools .
they call this streaming trials in the united states , we call this tracking .
the students are divided by grades .
and the a students are literally tested harder , get the better teachers and so on .
they then wrote , over a three - month period , students with a " very good " they were told they were smart , that they were very smart , and after those three months , they really wrote one . and . then
and of course , it makes your heart to hear thatly , the one students were told that they ' re just enough . and
and that ' s the same after the three months , it was . it
but only those who were still in school - except for the students who had thrown the school .
and the key about this study was that the teachers weren ' t enterred .
the teachers didn ' t know that something was changed .
they were just told that these are were the one students and they are the students with at the grade , and the also they taught them something and treateded them .
the only real disability is a broken mind is a mind that has been broken has no hope . he ' finds find anything moremore . he lacks our natural , childish curiosity , and our innate ability of imagination .
but if we can support the human mind , continue hoping to find yourself itself and other people around us to be curious and imaginative , we really apply our forces positive .
if a mind has these qualities , we can create a new reality and a new forms of existence .
i want to end with a poem written by a persian poet called khaz in the 14th century , and my friend jacques dembois told me about me , and the poem is called " the god who only knows four words . " every child knows god , not the god of names , not the god of pros , but the god who knows only knows four words and all time , always says , " come , dance with me . " . " century i says " . "
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
suppose i said that , through a few changes in your genes , they could have a better memory - accurate , more faster and faster .
or do you want to be fitier , stronger , more power . or
do you want to become more attractive and more confident ?
how about live longer with good health ?
or maybe you ' re one of those who ' s ve always cr lookingng for more creativity .
which one would you like the most ?
which would you like to want if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about as many as there are creative people are here .
that ' s very good .
how many would choose good memory ?
just a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to see that as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is this all just illusion ?
or maybe is it be possible ? .
evolution has been a continuous issue here at the ted conference , but today i want to give you the view of a doctor view about this subject .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , t . g . krzhenansky , who was also a commun in the russian orthodox church , once wrote a essay called , " nothing in biology makes t make sense except in the light of evolution . "
now , if you ' re one of those who doesn ' t accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aids , take your personal communication device - i ' ll give you permission - and maybe you can take a look at kathryn schultzz ' s book , which is about being wrong , because nothing in the course of this talk will make any sense for you .
but if you accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it asslicable for others , or is it affecting us ?
this is another view at the tree of life .
in this picture , i put a bush as a center of branches in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the existing species at the top of these branches have succeeded in evolutionary terms : they survived ; it demonstrated fitness and strength in its environment .
the human part of this bush , far at the end , of course , is what we ' re most interested in .
we go from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago . we
in that period , there were maybe 20 or 25 different species of hominids .
some have come and left .
we ' ve been here for about 130 , 000 years .
it seems that we ' re quite remote from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually for the most part , the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are quite similar .
do you realize that we can take advantage from this and recquict the mechanisms of a common bacterium to produce the protein human insulin that which is used to treat diabetic ?
this is not like human insulin ; this is the same protein that is chemically irable from what comes from the pancreatic .
and when we ' re talking about bacteria , do you realize that each one of us in our gut has more bacteria than it cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , do you think when antonio damasio asks about your self - portrait , do you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderfully hospital environment for these bacteria .
it ' s warm , it ' s dark , it ' s wet , it ' s very comfortable .
and you ' re going to give them all the nutrients that they could only wish without any effort on their own .
it ' s really a easy way for bacteria , with occasional interruptions of the unintended , je forced to the end .
but otherwise , they ' re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as well as they are important for their life .
they help digest essential nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will happen in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium in the form of a species ?
or are we certainly likely to become something else - something that may might even more adapted to the environment ?
now let ' s take a step back to the time of the big bang , 14 billion years ago - the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago - the first signs of living , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth - the first more - cellular organisms , maybe so much as 800 or a billion years ago - and then the human species , that formss in the last 130 , 000 years . the , - the , forms , . years ago
in this huge unfinished symphony of the universe , life on earth is just short measured ; the animal kingdom , like a single note ; and human life , a little . in
that ' s us . that
this also represents the entertainment value of this talk , so i hope d ' you enjoyed it .
now , when i was a newman in college , i had my first biology classes .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i realized something very fundamental : in most of them , the existence of life in single - organisms , each cell divides , and all the genetic information of the cell is passed on in both daughter cells .
but at the time that when multicellular organisms appeared , things began to change .
sexual reproduction enters into the picture .
and most importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction that the genome passes , the rest of the body becomes horcious .
in fact , you could say that the inevitability of the death of our body occurs evolution at the same moment as sexual reproduction .
now i have to admit , when i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex - it seemed pretty reasonable at that point , but with every year , it came to my increasing doubts .
i came to understand the feelings of george burns who performing his show in the ' 90s .
and one night , there ' s a knock on his hotel room door .
he opens the door .
is a beautifully poorly - dressed showgirl in front him .
she looks at him and she says , " i ' m here for super - sex . "
" that ' s wonderful , " george says , " i ' m going to take the soup . "
i came to the conclusion as a doctor that i was working with a goal that was different from than the goal of evolution - not necessarily contradictory , just different . i
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i wanted to restore the health after a disease .
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the extending the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation after generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , you and i are developed like booster rockets to send the genetic material to the next stage of the orbit , and then drop into the sea .
i think we ' d all understand the mood that woody allen expressed when he said , " i don ' t want to reach immortality through my work .
i want to do it by not dying . "
evolution doesn ' t necessarily prefer the longest life .
it doesn ' t necessarily privovil the biggest , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution privil priviles the creatures that best adapt to their environment .
it ' s only the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , there are bacteria that are thermophily , and survive the hot steam otherwise , if fish were there , it would have a vacuumly - cooked fish , yet they managed to make a habitable environment for .
so , what does that mean when we look back at what happens in evolution , and how we think about the place of humans in evolution , and especially important as we look forward into the next phase , i would say that there are a number of possibilities .
the first is that we ' re not going to evo developlve .
we ' ve reached some kind of balance . we
and the reason for that was that , of all , first we did able to get a lot of genes that would have otherwise been selected and be removed from the population . and
and secondly , we , as a species , we designed our environment so that we made it to adapt to us just as we adapt to it .
and by the way , we travelrate and circulate and mix so much that they can no longer say that isolation is necessary for evolution to happen .
a second possibility is that it ' s going to be an evolution of traditional species , of course , imposed by nature s forces of nature .
and the argument , here would be that the wheels of evolution are slowly scmpiinding , but they ' re relentificale .
and as far as isolation goes , if we colonize distant planets as a species , there will be isolationtion and changes in the environment that evolution could naturally produce . and .
but there ' s a third possibility , a tempting , fascinating and terrifing possibility .
i call it neo - evolution - the new development that which is not just natural , but led and determined by us as individuals , in the choices that we make .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let ' s first look at the reality that people today , in some cultures , make decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , choice to have more men than women .
it ' s not necessarily good for society , but it ' s what the individual and the family decide .
so think , if it was not only possible to choose the gender of your child , but also do genetic adaptations to the body to cure and prevent the disease .
what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer ' s or eliminate reducing the risk of cancer or strokes ?
wouldn ' t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
as we look forward , these kinds of changes will become possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2 . 7 billion dollars .
the next year , when it finished in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in three to four months .
today , you can complete a sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a price of about 20 , 000 and in into the room of about a week . today .
it won ' t going take a long for the reality to be that there will be the 1 , 000 - dollar human genomes , and it ' s going to become more available for everyone .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering gave the draper prize for francis arnold and willem stemmer , two scientists who developed techniques independently that encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and lead desired proteins in a more efficient way - which frances arnold calls " direct evolution . " . "
a few years ago , the flker prize was awarded to the scientist shinya yama for his research in which he took an adult skin cell , a fibroid , and by manipulapulation only four genes that induced the cell to bring it to a pluripotent stem cell - a cell is potentially able to become any cell in your body .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that the human insulin produces in bacteria can make viruses that can not only protect from themselves , but also serve immunizing against other viruses . the
believe it or not , it ' s an experimental study going with vaccine against influenza that was grown in the cells of a cigare plant .
can you imagine something good that comes out from cigarettes ?
this is all reality today , and in the future much more be possible .
then just imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change your ancestors ' cells ?
what if you could change the sperm and egg or the fresh - fertilited egg to give your children a better chance of a healthier life - eliminate diabetes , eliminate hemophily , reduce the risk of cancer ? what
who doesn ' t want healthier kids ?
and then the analytical technology , the same engine of science that can enable change to prevent disease , could also allow us to adopt super - attributes , hyper - capacity - the better memory . and
why don ' t have the power of ken jennings hb , especially if you can expand it with the next generation of the watson machine ?
why not have the fast fiber that will allow them to run faster and longer ?
why no longer live ?
these will be compelling .
and if we ' re in a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we ' will going be transformed from old - style evolution to neo - evolution .
we ' re going to have a process that may usually maybe 100 , 000 years , and we can compress it to a thousand years - and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions that their grandchildren , or their grandchildren have to deal with .
do we use these decisions to form a society that ' s better , that is more successful , that is more friendly ?
or are we going selectively choose different attributes that we want to have for some of us rather not others of us ?
will we become create a society of more and more uniformized , or more robust and more diverse ?
these are the kinds of questions we ' re going to face .
and deepest of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and master the wisdom that we ' re going to need to make these those decisions way ? and
in the good or in evil , and earlier than you might think , these decisions will be independent on us . for
thank you .
now i want you to imagine something , a portable robot that gives you superhum skills , or another that helps wheelchair users get back up and walk .
we at berkeley bionics , we call these robots exoskeletons .
they ' re nothing but something they put up in the morning and that gives them extra strength and that will increase their speed , and that will help them keep their balance .
that ' s actually the real union of human and machine .
but not only that - that merges and connect to the universe and other devices out there .
it ' s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we ' re working on , we start talking about the american soldier who ' s on average about 100 pounds on his back , and there ' s a question that you should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications - back injuries , 30 percent of them - chronic back injuries .
so we thought we would tackle this challenge and create an exoskelet that would help deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you to hulc now - or the human universal load carrier .
soldier : with the hulc exoskel , i can carry 200 pounds over different terrain for many hours .
his flexible design allows you to sit deep , to crawl , and do extremely agile movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then increase my strength and perseverace .
we ' re ready to introduce with our industrial partner this device , this new exoskelett this year .
so it ' s true .
now let ' s take our look at the wheelchair users , something that i ' m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people estimated sitting in a wheelchair around over the world .
that ' s about one percent of the population .
and that ' s actually a conservative estimate .
we often talk about very young people with spinal cord injuries who were hit in the flowering of their lives - 20s , ' 30s , ' 40s - fate , and the wheelchair is the only option . we
but it ' s also about the aging population , whose number is multiublingying .
and pretty much the only option - when it comes to a stroke , or other complications - is the wheelchair .
and so by the way , it ' s been 500 years since his i have to say very successful introduction .
so we thought that we could start writing a whole new chapter in mobility .
now let me introduce you to idness being carried by amanda boxtel , who had a spinal cord injury 19 years ago that resulted that she couldn ' t walk for 19 years and so now .
thank you . thank
as i said , amanda is wearing our goodness .
it has sensors .
his fully non - invasive sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer , which is attached on your back .
here are also battery pack , the engine is on your hips , as well as your knees that move you forward in this fairly smooth and very natural gait . here
i was 24 years old and in the best position when a monstrous rolling tree a ski trip paral me paral .
for a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and movement belownea my abdomenvis .
not long after that , a doctor walked into my hospital room , and he said , " amanda , you ' ll never leave again . "
and this was 19 years ago .
he stealed every spark of hope from my consciousness .
adaptive technologies have allowed me to learn to ski again , climb , and even ride with my hands .
but nothing was invented that would let me go , so far .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet us and talk to them .
it ' s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change the life of future generations - not just for the soldiers , or for amanda here and all the wheelchair users , but for everyone . it . it everyone
thank you .
at home in new york , i ' m the head of the development department of a nonprofit organization called robin hood .
if i don ' t fight poverty , as a backup a fireman , i fire in a volunteer fire fight .
now , in our city where volunteers supported a highly trained professional guards , you have to be at the fire store for pretty early to participate . now .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer at the fire station , so i had pretty good opportunities to get in it . i .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach the chief and figure out what our tasks would be .
when i found the captain , he had just had a very serious conversation with the homeowner , who probably had one of the worst days of her life . when .
it was in the middle of the night , and she stood in the sleeping suit and barefoot under a umbrella outside in the falling rain while her house was in burning . it
the other volunteer who had arrived up to me - let ' s call him lex luther - first came to the chief first and was asked to go to the house and save the dog of the house dog . the
the dog ! i was totallysed ensed .
there was any lawyer or trust holder who , now , for the rest of his life , could tell people that he went into a burning house to save a an living thing , just because he was five seconds faster than i did .
well , i was next .
the captain waveed me up .
he said , " bezos , you have to go to the house . he
you have to go up , past the fire , and you have to get this woman a pair of shoes . "
i swear .
now , not exactly what i had hoped , but i went off - up the stairs , down the hallway , past the real firemen , who were , at that point , cleaning pretty done into the bedroom to get a pair of shoes .
i know what you ' re thinking now , but i ' m not a hero . i
i carried my prey back to down , where i met on the door my enemy and met my beloved dog .
we carried our treasures out to the owner , where , not surprisingly , got his a lot more attention than mine did .
a few weeks later , the fireman got a letter from the home thanking for the brave effort of saving her house .
onereciated kindness : somebody had even brought her a pair of shoes .
both in my profession with robin hood and in my side job as a volunteer fireman , i witness generosity and kindness at a large scale , but i also see acts of charity and the courage of individuals .
and you know what i ' ve learned ?
they ' re all important .
so when i look around this room and i see people who have either achieved a remarkable success or are on their way there , i want to offer you this memory : don ' t wait .
don ' t wait to make a difference in someone else ' s life until you reach your first million .
if you have something to give , give it now .
serve in a soup kitchen , open up a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us a chance to save the lives of a human , but every day will gives us the opportunity to change one thing .
so go ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno giacometi : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i ' m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of human resce .
a place where women lead the car say with sex " hello , and the game determines the day - where fun is a serious issue .
and no , it ' s not burning man or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , your family .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the congo .
bonobos are our closest living relatives with chimzees .
that means that we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , that lived about six million years ago .
now chimpanzees are famous for their aggression .
but unfortunately , we have overstatedked that aspect in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos showing us the other side of the coin .
while chimpanzees run led by big , fearying guys , the bonobo society is run by empowered females .
they really came up with , because this leads to a very tolerant society where lethal violence has not been seen .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least known among the primates .
they live in the depths of the congo basin jungle , and they ' re very difficult to observation .
the congo is a paradox - a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself - the tomb of a violent conflict that has been dooming for decades and almost as many lives as the first world war .
it ' s not surprising that this destruction also riskens the survival of bonobos .
meat trade and the decline of the tree leads you couldn to t even fill a stadium with the remaining bonobos - and even we ' re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a hidden laugh that shas the trees .
who are these relatives ?
we know them as " love instead of war " monkeys because they have frequent , also heterosexual sex , with changing partners , and they govern define conflicts and social issues .
i ' m not saying that would be the answer to all humanitarian problems - because the bonobos ' life consists of more than the kama sutra .
bonobos - like humans - love to play their lifetime .
play doesn ' t just play .
for us and it , play is fundamental to attament relationships and maintaininging of tolerance .
that ' s where we learn trust and the rules of the game . that
play increases creativity and resilience , and it ' s particularly about creating diversity - diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and if you watch bonobos in the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human laughter , dance and rituals .
play is the glue that keeps us together .
now , i don ' t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique footage just away from the wild .
first , a ball game of bonobo style - and i don ' t think about football .
so here ' s a young female and male in a chase game .
look at what it does .
this could be the evolutionary origin of , " she packs it in the eggs . "
just that i think he rather liked it , right ?
yeah !
so sex games are is pre common , both in bonobos and in humans .
and this video is really interesting because it shows - and this video is really interesting because it shows the ideas that bringing new elements into play - like the testicles - and also how the game promotes both trust and promotes - at the same time it is tremendous fun . and
but the game is a shape shifter .
play is a shape - shifting , and it can take on many shapes , some of which are a little quieter , imaginative , curious - perhaps to redcover the wonder .
and i want to show you , this is yuku , a young female , and she plays peacefully with waterly .
i think just like you we sometimes play alone , and we explore out boundariestions of our inner and outer worlds .
and it ' s this playful curiosity that makes us explore and interact , and the unexpected connections that we form are the real breeding ground of creativity . and
this is just a little taste of the insights that bonobos give us into our past and present .
but they also share a secret to our future , a future in which we need to adapt to rising challenges through greater creativity and slh increasedened cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our adaptation dragon .
to adapt to an unreled world , we have to play .
but are we going to do the best of our game drive ?
play is not silly .
it ' essential . it
for bonobos and humans equally the same way , life is not teeth and claws alone .
even when it hardly seems appropriate , play is perhaps the most necessary .
and so , my primate friends , let ' s embrace this gift of evolution and play together as we rediscover creativity friendship and wonder . and
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs in the middle - 1979 , exactly the same day , exactly the same moment , each one has a baby - okay . i
so two pairs , each one has a baby .
now , i don ' t want you to spend too much time to imagine the babyth , because if you imagine the babyth all the time , you won ' t listen to me . now .
just think about that for a moment .
and in this scenario , imagine that in a case , the sperm has a y gramomosoma hitting the x chromosome of the egg .
and in the other case , the sperm carriess an x chromosome that hits the x chromosome of the egg .
both are surviveble , both spark .
we ll come back to these people later .
most of my work , i have two hats on .
under a hat , i ' m looking dealing with the history of anatomy .
i ' m a studied a historian , and in this case , i study how people dealt with anatomy - which is human bodies , animal bodies - how they dealt with body fluids , with body concepts , how they thought about bodies .
the other hat that i ' ve wore in my work is the activist , as a patient lawyer - or , i sometimes say , as an impatient lawyer - of people who are patients from doctors .
in this case , i worked with people who have body types that who question social norms .
so for example , i worked with people who are sioux twins , two people in a body . so
i worked with people with dwarfs - so people who were smaller than usual . i
and a lot i ' ve worked with intersexual people whose gender is at - so people who don ' t have the average male or female bodies .
and as a general term , we can use the word intergenderxuity .
interdexuity is happens in many different forms .
i ' m just going to give you a few examples of the potential types of sexual types that don ' t match the male standard or female standard .
in one case , you might have someone with a x chromosome base , and the sry gene of the y chomoso grows the protogona that we all have fetal stage . in
and that ' s why the testes are releasing testosterone at the stage .
but because this individual have no the receptors to recognize the testosterone , the body doesn ' t respond to the testosterone .
and this is called the androgen receptor bug .
so lot of testosterone , but no reaction to that . so
as a result , the body develops more like the typical female path .
when the child is born , it looks like a girl .
she ' s a girl . she ' s raised as a girl .
but it mostly time takes for her to reach puberty and her breasts grow and develop , but it doesn ' t get her period for somebody to come that ' something different here .
and they do some tests , and they find that instead of ovaries and uterus , it actually have testis in it and that it has a y chromosome .
and it ' s important to understand that you could actually think of this person as actually being male , but they ' re not really .
women , like men , have in our bodies something called adrenalin glands .
they ' re in the back of our body .
and the sidebones make andrones , which are virusizing hormones .
most women , like me - i think i ' being a typical woman - i don ' t know my actual chromosome structure , but i think i probably have the typical one - most women like me actually speak to andrones .
we produce androccines , and we talk to andrones . we
the consequence is that someone like me actually has a brain that was exposed more androgens than a woman who was born with testicles and has an androgen receptor defect .
so gender is really complicated ; intersexus aren ' t just in the middle of the spectrum of gender - in a way , they can be spread across the entire range . so
here ' s another example : a few years ago , i got the call from a 19 - year - old man who was born as a boy , raised as a boy , he had a girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , he lived as a man , and he had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus .
he had an extreme form of an innate by frontal posteriorsy .
he has xx chromosomes , and in the womb , his bypartsbones were so active that they basically created a male hormone environment . he
and as a result , his genitaliaes were identified in malely , his brain was exposed to the typical male part of the hormone spectrum .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy - nobody knew anything .
and it wasn ' t until turned was 19 that he got enough medical problems , actually because he menstructed inside , that the doctors found out that he was female inside . it
okay , just a quick example of a variation of intergenderity .
some people with xx chromosomes develop something called ovotetins , which where ovary tissue of testi tissue covered .
we don ' t know exactly why this is happening .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason why children with this kind of body - whether it ' s dwarfism or sioux twins , whether it ' s intersexu - are often adapted to the norms surgeons isn is not because it would be good for their physical health .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they often do different kinds of surgical surgery is because they threaten our social categories .
typically , our system is based on the idea that a certain anatomic characteristic comes with a particular identity .
so we have the concept that being a woman is about having a female identity ; to being a black person is supposedly have having an african anatomy in terms of your own history . so
so we have this terly simplistic idea .
and when we ' re faced with a body that actually represents something very different to us , it confuses us in terms of these categorizations .
so in our culture we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualism .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
now you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born who are two people in a body .
where i ' ve had the most excitedng recently , was the south african runner caster semenya last year , whose gender was questioned at the cross championship in berlin .
a lot of journalists called me question , " what test are you going to do that will tell us whether caster semenya is female or male ? "
and i had to explain to the journalist that this test is there exist .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature doesn ' t draw a line between male and female , or between male and inter and female and inter ; in , we ' are re the ones who define this line as natural .
so we have a situation where , the further our science progress , we have to admit so much more that these categories that we thought were stable anatomic categories that made very simple assignments to create permanent identity categories are much blurry than we assumed . so a so
and that ' s not just in terms of gender .
it ' s also true in terms of race , which turns out to be much more complicated than our terminology has allowed .
in our investigations , we get into all kindss of inconveniable areas .
for example , we find the fact that we share have at least 95 percent of our dna in common with chimpanzees .
what should we do with the fact that we are distinguish different from them by a few nucleotides ?
as we push our science further and , we increasingly into a zone of awmfort where we need to recognize that the simplistic categories that we had are probably are too simple . as
we see this in all sorts of parts of human life . we
one of the areas in which we see this in play in our culture today , in united states today , is the battles over the beginning and the end of life .
we have hard conversations about where a body becomes human , so that it has a different right than fetal life .
we have very difficult debates today - maybe not as public as in medicine - about the question of when someone is dead . we .
our ancestors had never been so hard to fight with the question of when someone was dead .
they you only have put a feather under their nose , and as it moved , they haven ' t buried them yet .
when it ' t moving , they buried it .
but today we ' re in a situation where we want to take out vital organs and to trans them to other people .
and as a result , we get oursel in fighting with the really difficult question of when someone is dead , and that puts us into in a really difficult situation where we don ' t have as simple categories as we used to do be . and
now you might think that the whole breakdown of categories would make someone like me really happy .
i ' m politically progressive , i defend people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit it makes me nervous .
realize that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought makes me excited .
and it makes me excited about discussions about democracy .
so to tell you about this tension , i first have to conmit that i ' m a big fan of the founding father . so
i know they were racists , i know they were sexists , but they were great .
i think they were so brave and so strong , and so radical , in what they did , that i found myself every few years watching the grting music in 1776 , and it ' s not because of the music that ' s absolutely forgotten .
it ' s because of what happened in 1776 with the founding fathers of in 1776 .
the founding fathers , in my view , were the original anatomic activists , and that ' s why .
what they returned was an anatomical concept , and they replaced it with another one , which was radical and beautiful , and was 200 years important to us .
as you all remember , our founding fathers rejected the concept of the monarchy , and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplified concept of anatomy .
the rulers of the ancient world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of birthright .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they believed that people who had political power should have that political power because of the inherited blood line from grandfather to father to son and so on .
the founding fathers rejected this idea and replaced it with a new anatomical concept , and this that concept said that all humans were created equally equal .
they scaled the field , and they decided that anatomically , who counted similarities , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they did this part because they were part of a metaing system where two things grew together .
democracy grew , but at the same time science also grew .
if you look at the history of the founding fathers , it becomes clear that many of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a naturalist world . if .
they went away from explanations of supernatural species , andd things like a supernatural concept of power , where the transmission is based on a very basic concept of birth right . they
they moved towards a naturalist concept .
and for example , if you look at the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature . and
they ' re not talking about god and the nature of god . they
they ' re talking about the nature power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of it , they gave us a concept was about anatomical similarities . and
and so they in a really wonderful way prepared the future civil rights movement .
they didn ' t think about it way , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened years after that ?
for example , women who aspired the right , the concept of the founding fathers , which says that anatomical commonness is more important than the anatomical difference , and said , " that we have a uterus and ovaries is not significant enough that we shouldn ' t have the right to , the right to have full citizenship , the right to property , etc . , etc . " .
and women successfully argued .
next was the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like someone woman truth enjoying about it , " am i not a woman ? "
we find men in the march rows of the civil rights movement who say , " i ' m a man . "
again , people of different skin color re on anatomical similar before anatomical differences , again , successful .
we see the same thing with the disability rights movement .
of course , the problem is that , as we start to looking at all the similarities , we need to begin to question why we sus maintain certain divisions .
now , by the way , i want to maintain certain divisions , anatomically , in our culture .
for example , i want not to give a fish the same rights as a human being .
i don ' t want to say that we should take away from anatomy .
i don ' t want to say that five year olds should have the right to give their consent about sex or marry .
so there are some anatomical divisionss that make sense for me that i think we should keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out which ones they are and why we keep them , and whether they ' re usefulful .
so let ' s go back to these two creatures that were created at the beginning of the talk .
we created two creatures , both born in the middle - 1979 exactly the same day . we
let ' s imagine that one of them , maria , was born three months fertilited , so she was born on june 1 june , 1980 .
henry , on the other hand , is born to the birth date , so he ' s born on march 1 1980 .
just because of the fact that maria was born three months prematilily , she demands all kinds of rights three months before henry - the right to consensus sex , the right to choose to drink the right to drink .
henry has to wait for all of this , not because he actually has a different biological age , just because of the time he was born .
we find other oddities about what their rights are .
henry , since you assume that he ' s male - although i didn ' t tell you that he ' s with xy - since you assume that he ' s male , he can now be drawn in something what maria doesn ' t have to worry about .
however maria , in all states see the same right that henry has in all states , which is the right to marry .
elizabeth can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only marry a woman in a few states .
so we have these permanent anatomical categories that are problematic and questionable in many ways .
and for me , the question is , what are we going to do because our science is making such advances in anatomy that we reach to a point where we have to admit that a democracy based on anatomy might fall apart ?
i don ' t want to give up the science , but at the same time sometimes it feels like science is itself . i .
so where do we go going ?
it seems like our culture takes a kind of pragmatic post : " well , we have to draw a line somewhere , so we ' ll pull it somewhere . "
but a lot of people are caught in a very strange position .
so for example , texas at one point decided that marrying a man means you don ' t have a y chromosome , and marry a woman means you have a y chromosome . so
now in practice , people are not tested on their chromosomes .
but it ' s also very bizarre because of the story i first told you about the androgen receptor virus .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr . martin luther king , he offers us kind solution in his " i have a dream . " if
he says we should not judge people by " their skin color , but by the character of their character , " and go goes way beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , " yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . "
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you judge people based on their personality ?
i also want to point out that i ' m not sure we should spread rights in terms of people , because i have to admit that i know a series of golden retrievers who probably deserve social benefits than some people i know .
i want to say that i probably also know some bright dog dogs who are more able to make more informed , more intelligent and more mature decisions about their sexual relationships than some 40 - year - olds i know .
so how should we operationalize the question of the properties of character ?
it turns out to be really hard .
and part of me wonder , what if the content of a personality was something that would machine - readble in the future - could be visible using fmri ?
do we really want to go that way ?
i ' m not sure where we ' re going .
what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is leading thinking about questions of democracy .
in our effort for democracy , we did really well , and i think we would do our business good in the future .
we don ' t have the situation , as , for example , in iran , where a man who feels sexually attracted to other men is punished with to death , unless he ' s willing to intergo a sexual transformation in which case he can stay alive .
conditions of these kinds things don ' t exist to us .
i ' m happy to say that we don ' t have these conditions - a surgeon who i talked to a few years ago , who had brought a some sioux twins to separate them , in part to make themselves a name .
but when i was talking to him , and i asked him why he was doing these surgeries - they were very risky surgeries - his answer was that in his country , these kids would be treated very poorly , and so ' he had to do it . but
i said asked him , " now do you consider political isolation instead of an operation to separate you ? "
the united states provides incredible opportunities to allow people to be who they are without having to change for the state .
so i think we need to be more leaders leader .
well right , just to conclude , i want to notice that i ' ve talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibilities that what democracy might look like , or might have looked like if we got mothers more involved . and
and i want to say something that ' s a little radical to a feminist , and that is i think there might may be different kinds of insights that come from different kinds of anatomy , especially when people use a group thinking . and
for years , since because i ' ve been interested in intergenderxuityty , i ' ve also been interested in research on gender transty .
and one of the things that i found really interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and act in the world . and
what we ' ve learned from cultural cross - cultural studies is that women , on average - not everyone , but on average - tend to pay complex social relationships and care for people who are vulnerable inside within the group , pay a lot of attention . what
and that ' s , when we think about it , we have an interesting situation ahead to us .
years ago , when i graduated from graduate school , one of my college advisers , who knew my interest in feminism - i considered myself as a feminist , so i does - asked a really strange question .
he said , " tell me what s female about feminism . "
and i thought , " well , that ' s the stupidest question i ' ve ever heard .
feminism is about dissoing stereotypes about gender , so feminism is not female .
but the more i thought about his question , the more i thought there could be something female about feminism .
that mean there could be something on average , which makes female brains are different from male , makes us more alert about highly complex social relationships and more alert the protect needy .
so where the founding fathers were extremely determined to figure out how individuals could be protected from the state , it ' s possible that if we put more mothers in this concept , we got more a concept of , not just how to protect , but how to care for each other .
and maybe that ' s where we need to go in the future if we take democracy beyond anatomy - thinking less about the individual body in terms of identity , and think more about relationships . and
so that as try to make a better perfect connection people , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i ' m jess , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have in it , i ' m going to make a very public confession , and that ' s : i ' m obsessed with outfits . but .
i love at any opportunity to find a different colorful , crazy outfit , and photographing and blogging recently .
but i don ' t buy anything new . but
i get all my second -hand clothes on marketplaces and in second - hand shops .
ooh , thank you .
second - hand shopping allows me to reduce the impact of my clothes on the environment and also the impact on my wallse .
i meet all sorts of great people ; my dollars usually serve a good purpose ; i look pretty unique ; and it makes shopping my personal treasure .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it be my sizeness ?
am i going to like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
when all the answers are yes loud , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase and tell you what i packed for exciting here at ted week .
i mean , what does someone with so many outfits ?
so i ' m going to show you very exactly what i brought with me .
i brought seven pair of underwear with me , and that ' s all .
underwear for exactly a week are all i did in my suitcase .
i bet that i would find everything else i might wanted to wear if i first came to palm springs .
and since you haven ' t heard about me as the woman who ' s walking around in her underwear at ted - does that mean i ' found a few things .
and i really want to show you my outfits for this week . and
does that sound good ?
as i do that , i ' m also going to leave you some of the lessons that i , believe it or not , have learned from these adventures to carry new about .
let ' s start with sunday .
i call this the shining tiger .
you don ' t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jacket , took me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece i wore this whole week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it ' s almost physiologically impossible to be bad paral when you ' re wearing bright pants .
when you ' re happy , you attract other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation is totally over .
i ' ve spent a lot of my life trying to be myself and adapting at the same at the same time .
just be who you are .
when you surround yourself you with the right people , you will not only to understand it , you ' ll also appreciate it .
wednesday : hubrag your inner child .
sometimes people tell me i looked like i ' m playing " dressing up " or that i remind them of their seven - year - old .
i like to smile and say , " thank you . "
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you look good in a good something , it ' s almost safe .
and if you think you don ' t look good in something , you ' re probably right .
i grew up with a mother was teaching me day after day .
but it wasn ' t until i turned 30 that i really understood what that means .
and i ' m going to summarize that for you for . i and
if you think that you ' re a wonderful person in inside and outside , there ' s nothing you can ' t wear .
so there ' s no excuse to anyone in this audience .
we should be able to rock everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth - five words : golden pillletes fit everything .
and finally , saturday : developing your own unique personal style is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word . and
i was proved myself over and over again when people came up to me this week just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , that ' s not all going to fit in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i ' m going to donate all again .
because the lesson i ' m trying to learn myself this week is that it ' s okay to let go .
i don ' t have to emotionally em these things , because right around the corner , there will always be another crazy , colorful , bright outfit that ' s just waiting for me if i have a little love in my heart and search for it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good day , everyone together .
i have something i want to show you .
think of this as a picture , as a flying spot .
this is what we call in our lab , perceptual design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture - i ' m originally italian , and every boy in italy is growing up with this picture in his room , but the reason i ' m showing you this is because that has something very interesting in the last few decades .
a while ago , if you wanted to win a formula 1 race , you took your budget and you put your money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now today , if you want to win a race , you actually need something like this - something that monitor the car monitor in real time , has a few thousand sensors that sent information from the car , pass that information to the system and then process it and then use it to send decisions back and change things in real time as information is being collected . now to
this would call , in engineering teams , a real - time control system .
and basically , it ' s a system that ' s made up of two parts - a repeating part and a reactive part .
what ' s interesting today is that real - time control systems are start beginning to appear in our lives .
our cities , over the last few years , have been equipped with networks and electronics .
they become computers in opens . they
and as computers in the opens , they start to react in different ways , they ' re perceived and driven . and
when we zoomed to cities , that ' s actually a big deal .
just by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the world ' s land surface , but 50 percent of the world ' s population lives there .
they ' re 75 percent of the energy consumption - causes up to 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , that ' s a big deal . so
beyond the cities , all of this perceis and brings into objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhibition that paola antonelli organized for moma later this the year during the summer .
it ' s called " talk to me . "
now , all of our objects , our environment , begin to speak back to us .
in a certain sense , it ' s almost as if every atom out there becomes both , a sensor and an generator .
and this radically changes the interaction that we humans have out with our environment .
in a way , it ' s almost like the old dream of michelangelo .
you know , when michelangelo shaped the moses , it says that at he ended he took the hammer and threw it on moses - in fact , you can still see a little place in the bottom - and he said , said , " per ' t no parli ? why don ' t you talk ? "
well , today , our environment begins to respond us .
i ' m just going to show you a few examples - again , with the idea of perving andcating our environment .
let ' s start with perceiving .
now the first project i want to introduce to you is actually one of the first of our lab . now
it was in italy four and a half years ago .
and what we ' ve did then was actually use a new kind of network that was deployed all over the world then - that ' s a mobile phone network - and use anonymous and organizedd information from this network that ' s currently being collected by the operator to understand how the city works . and then
the summer was a happy summer - 2006 .
it was when italy won the football world cup .
some of you will remember it was when italy playing against france , and then at the end of thedan , the head shake .
and anyway , italy ended up winning . and
now look at what happened that day , just watching the activity that ' s happen in the network .
here you see the city .
you see in the middle the colossal , the river tiber .
in the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline up top .
early afternoon , people here and there making calls and moving .
the game begins - silence .
france makes a gate . italy makes a gate .
half - time , people make a quick phone call , go to the bathroom .
second half hour . end of the normal season .
first extension , second .
zi , in a moment , the head shakeffs .
italy wins . yeah .
now , that night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
they saw the big deal .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the winning team and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everybody went down .
you see the picture of the place cigo massimo , where , since the roman times , people go to celebrate - to have a big party , and you see the impact at the end of the day . you
now , this is just an example of how we can feel the city today in a way that we couldn ' t do a few years ago .
, another example of traces : this is not about people , this is about things that we use and consume .
well , today we know everything about where our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that make up a mac computer how they came together .
but we only know little about where these things go .
so in this project , we actually designed a some little markers to track the garbage as it goes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers who helped us , a little over a year ago , in seattle tag the things they were throwing away - different kinds of things you can see - things that they would throw away anyway .
then we put the little chips , the little brands , on the garbage and we started tracking it .
here are the results that we just got .
from seattle .
after a week . after
with this information , we realized that there ' s a lot of inefficies in the system .
we can actually do the same things with less energy .
the data was t available before .
but that ' s what a lot of unnecessased transportation and complicated things that happen .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup that we throw away doesn ' t just disappear , that it ' s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we throw away every day still remains there .
and if we showed show this to people that , then we can drive behavior change .
so that ' s the reason this project .
my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , could tell you a lot more about perceiving and the many other wonderful things you can do with perceiveving , but i ' d like to talk to the second part that we discussed at the beginning , and that ' s the improvement of our environment . and ,
and the first project is something we did a few years ago in saraza , spain .
it began with a question of the mayor who came to us and said that spain and southern europe have a beautiful tradition of using water as part of the architecture in . it
and the question was , how could you connect technology , new technology with it ?
and one of the ideas that was collected at mit in a work group was imagine these tubes , and valves , magnetic valves , valves that open and close . and
they create something like a water pilin with glass points of water .
if when these spots fall down , you can write on it , you can display patterns , images , text .
and you can approach it him , and he ' s going to open up to let it jump , as you can see in this picture .
well , we introduced mayor belloch .
he lovedd very much .
and we got a commission to design a building at the entrance of the expo .
we called it the digital water pavilionvil .
the whole building was made of water .
there are no doors or windows , but when you approach it , it will open and let you in .
the roof was also covered in water as well .
and if it ' s windy , if you want to reduce the syringe , you can actually even drop the roof down .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture will be , like in this case , you know , this day , when you walk down the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and saying , " you destroyed the building . "
no , they didn ' t destroy the building , it ' s just that architecture almost disappears .
here ' s how the building works .
you see the person wondering what ' s going on inside .
and here you see me when i was trying to testing the sensors that opened the water to get wet .
now , i should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working .
but actually , that night it was a even bigger fun .
all the children from zara came to the building because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to let them in , but a building that still had breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump now without getting wet .
and this was , very exciting for us , because as architects , as engineers , as designers , we always think about how the people who use things that we design . and .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and that ' s the beauty of creating things that are used and interacting with people .
so here ' s a picture of the building with the physical points , the from water and the projections on it . so
and this is what led us think about the next project that i ' m going to showing you now .
imagine these spots could really start flying .
imagine if you could have little helicopters flying through the air , and each of them with a little image with changing light - almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here ' s the video .
imagine a helicopter like the one you saw earlier that moves with others , completely synchronized .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display like this - a uniform formation in two dimensions .
or irregular , in three dimensions , where what changes is the light , not the position of the points of the image .
you can play with different kinds .
imagine the screen could just appear in different formats or dimensions , in different resolutions .
but then the whole could be just a 3d cloud of points that you can walk through and through that you can move through , that you can see from many , many directions . but
here ' s a real flyfire controller that goes down to form a smooth v like to before .
when you turn on the lights on , it looks like this . so the like we saw seen it before .
imagine that every single one by people is controlling .
every single image of images could have a pulse that comes from people , from the movements of ' people or something anything like .
i want to show you something first of all here .
we worked with roberto bolle , one of the best ballet dancers of our time - the elan at the metropolitan theater in new york and the scala in milan - we recorded his movements in 3d to use them as an impulse for the flyfire . we
here you see roberto dancing .
on the left - hand side you see the positions of marks , the different impressions captured .
it ' s also a real - time 3d scan and a motion shot .
so you can understand the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then once we have all the images points , you can play with it and play with color of gravity and rotation . but
what we want to use to this as a possible impulse for the flyfire .
i want to show you the latest project that we ' re working on .
it ' s something we ' re working on for the london olympics .
it ' s called the cloud - the cloud .
the idea is again , imagine that we ' re bringing people to do something and change the environment - almost what we call building cloud movement like move a windstor , but with a cloud .
imagine that everybody can give a little donation for a look view .
i think the remarkable thing of what happen over the last years , the last decades , is that we ' ve moved from a physical world to a digital world .
this has digitized , knowledge , and made it accessible through the internet .
today , for the first time - and the obama campaign has shown this - we can move from the digital world , from the self - organizing forces of the networks to the physical world .
this can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
this is something that is built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can be to face the coming challenges - think about climate change or co2 emissions - how can we move from the digital world to the physical . ? . but
so the idea is that we actually engage people by doing things together , collectively .
the cloud is again a cloud of image points , in the same way as a real cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of points .
it ' s a physical object in london , but covered with images points .
you can move inside and have different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , share the most important moments for olympics in 2012 and beyond , and use it as a kind of connection to the community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky and something at which you can go , like london ' s new mountaintop .
you can go in .
and a kind of digital sung at night - but most importantly , a new kind of experience for anyone who wants to go to the top .
thank you . thank
as an artist , i care to .
through my work , i ' m trying to express feel that people are not separated from nature and that everything is connected .
the first time almost 10 years ago i was in antarctica , where i saw my first icebergs .
i was exsed in awe .
my heart was rush , i was feeling dizzy as i was trying to grab what was front of me .
the icebergs around me were raging almost 60 meters out of the water , and i could only see that was one snowflake on another snowflake year after year .
icebergs are born as a calf of a glacier or breaking out of ice she .
each iceberg has its own individual personality .
they clearly interact with their environment and their experiences .
some people refuse to give up and clin to the bitter end , while others can ' t stand it and collapse in a sense of dramatic passion .
when you look at an iceberg , you easily think they ' re isolated , separate and alone , as we humans often see .
but the truth is far away .
as an iceberg melts , i breathe in its ancient atmosphere .
as the iceberg melts , it releases mineral - rich drinking water that feeds a lot of life .
i prete to my photographs of these icebergs as i taking portraits of my ancestors , awareness that they exist in these individual moments way and will never exist that again .
it ' s not a death when they melt ; it ' s not an end , it ' s a continuat of your path along the life cycle . it
some of the ice in the ice mountains that i photograph is very young - a few thousand thousands thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100 , 000 years old .
the last pictures i ' d like to show you are an iceberg that i photographed in kekilasuak in greenland .
very rarely , you ' re actually witnessing a rolling iceberg . very
here you see it .
on the left - hand side you see a little boat .
this is about five meters long . this
please look at the shape of the iceberg and where it is on the water line .
you can see here , he ' s starts rolling , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is standing there . you .
that ' s the average size of a greenland iceberg .
it reaches about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just like that , the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality .
thank you .
my life is really extraordinarily blessed by working on some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing i ' ve ever worked on was about this guy .
his name is tempt . his
tempt was one of the leading graffiti artists of the ' 80s .
then one day , he came back from walking and said , " dad , my legs are scratchling . "
and that was the outbreak of als .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i was facing him . i
i have a company that does design and animation , so graffiti is inevitably be a complex part of what we admire and attention in the world . i
so we decided to support tony - tempt - and his cause .
i met with his father and his brother and said , " we ' re going to give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? "
and his brother said , " i just want be able to talk to tony again .
i just want to go back with him , and i said , " wait a minute , isn ' t that - i saw stephen hawking - can ' t all paralyzed people communicate with these devices ? "
and he said , " no , only if you ' re to the higher society and you have remarkable insurance , you can really do that . "
ordinary people are not access these devices . "
and i said , " how do you communicate now ? "
anybody seen the movie " butterfly and diving bells ? "
that ' s how you communicate - that ' s how your fingers go .
i was amazed , " very archaic , how can that be ? "
so i came with the need to just write out a check , and instead i put out a check that i didn ' t have the slightest idea how to fix it .
i committed in place to his brother and his father - saying , " well , my proposal is this : tony ' s going to talk , we ' re going to get him a device , and we ' re going to find a way to do his art again .
because it ' s a farce that someone who still has all this cannot communicate it . "
so i spoke at a conference a few months later .
i met these people from grl , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and , and then draw it with a laser pointer on it that only detects the negative area .
so they move around and do art installations like this .
they say that all the things that are shown up there follow a life cycle .
it starts with the gender parts , then the fuckwords , then the bush denents , and finally people actually do art .
but there was always a life cycle life in their presentations .
so i went home and i ate dinner with my wife at dinner and i told her about everything , and we thought , " well , a second a second , if there ' s this technology to can use your eyes to control things , then we should find out a way that tempt can control a laser so that he can make graffiti again , that would be great . " . " so at so i make
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of back and forth of things , we accomplished some things . and
first of all , we pushed the doors to the insurance , and we actually got a device for that it can communicate with - a stephen hawking machine .
that was incredible .
and he ' s really extremely funny - i call him yoda because you talk to him , or you get an email , and you think , " i ' m so une , this guy is incredible . " and
we ' ve flewged seven programmers from all around the world - literally from all corners of the world - to our home .
my wife , my children and i moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy hackers and anarcists took our house .
a lot of our friends thought we were stupid to do that , and we came back , and all the images on the walls were drawn to graffiti .
but for over two weeks , we programmed , we went to the beach in venice , my kids got involved , my dog created , and we created this .
it ' s called the eyewriter , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap sunglasse that we bought on the beach of venice , some copper wire and some things from the grocery store and the electronics shops .
we took a ps3 camera , we broke it apart , we put it on an led light , and now we have a device that ' s free - you can build it yourself , we provide the code for free , the software can be downloaded for free .
so we created a device that ' s completely free of constraints .
no insurance can get away .
no hospital either .
any paralyzed can actually communicate or draw with their eyes .
thank you . thank
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to tempts ' s room . so
i love this picture because it ' s somebody else ' s room , and this is his room .
now there ' s all this riot before the great revelationvei . now
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of programming , nudeetin and log nights , tony drew the first time after seven years . and .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks beyond his life support system .
we turnedted his bed so he can see him outside .
we put a projector against the wall of the parking lot outside the hospital .
and he drew again for the first time in his family and friends - and you can just imagine what feeling that was in the parking lot .
funny , we also had to break into the parking lot , so we felt right like part of the spraying scene .
at the end of it , he sent us an email with this following content : " for the first time , i ' ve drawn something for seven years .
i feel like i was push underwater , and finally somebody pushed down and pulled my head up so i can breathe . "
isn ' t that overwhelming ?
this is something of like our fighting .
that keeps us up and it 's us move and forward .
and we need to improve a lot more better on this device .
it ' s an amazing device , but it ' s similar like a magic book .
and someone who has such an artistic potential deserves so much more .
so we ' re process of figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we ' ve given all sorts of recognition . been
we won a few awards . we
remember , it ' s free , none of us deserve it .
it all comes from our own pockets .
so the awards were , " oh , that ' s fantastic . "
armstrong twitterted about us , and then , in december , time magazine honored us as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
the coolest thing about this is - and this closes the whole circle - is this april , when ge moca in the inner city of los angeles called " art of the streets . "
and there are probably be pretty much the toughest representatives of street art scene here - banksy , shepard fairey , caws - all these guys will be there . and
temp is going be part of the show , which is s quite off .
so the basically what i ' m talking about is , when you see something that ' s impossible , you make it possible .
everything in this room was impossible - this stage , this computer , this microphone , the eyewrt - everything was impossible at point .
make it possible - all of you here .
i ' m not a programmer , and i ' ve never had anything to do with eye recognition technology before , but i just pickeded something and surrounded myself with amazing people so we could put something together .
and this question should that each of you should ask yourself , and every single day that you notice something that needs to be done , if not now , when then ? and if not me , who else then ? and
thank you .
so , i write for kids , and i ' m probably america ' s most widely read children ' s writer . so
and i always tell people that don ' t want to come like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but no one has ever chosen farmer .
today i want to tell you about circles and revelations . today
well , an enphany is usually something you find because you ' ve dropped fallen it somewhere .
you go around the block and you take it as an revelationphany . you
this is a painting of a circle . this
one of my friends did it - richard bollingbroke .
it ' s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you about today .
my circle started back in the ' 60s at high school in stow , ohio , where i was the a class .
i was the one who was got beaten the boy ' s toile green and blue every weekt until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by letting me use the toilet in the teacher ' s room .
that secretly did it .
she did it for three years .
and i had to get out of the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it took me to san francisco , california - i found a lover - and back in the ' 80s , i thought it important to do a job in aids organizations .
about three or four years ago , in the middle of the night i got a phone call from this teacher , woman , who said , " i have to see her .
i ' m sad that we ' ve never met each other as adults .
can you come to ohio , and please come with the man that i know you ' ve found him now .
and i should mention that i have spinatic cancer , and i please i want you to hurry up . "
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at her , we laughed , we cried , and we knew she had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we took them , and we took care of them , and we took care of their family because it was needed .
it was something we knew how to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to meet me as an adult meet me , she turned into a box full of ashes and was placed in my hands .
what had happened was that the circle had closed , it had become a circle - and the epi that i talked about appeared out .
the revelation is that death is part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything the rest of life needs .
it needs truth and beauty , and i ' m so glad that this has been mentioned so often mentioned today .
it needs the same - it needs dignity , love and pleasure , and it ' s up to us to give these things .
thank you . thank
imagine a big explosion as you go up to 1 , 000 feet .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
imagine a engine that makes click , click , click , click , click , click , click .
that sounds fearmidaening .
well , i had a unique place that day ; i was sitting on 1d .
i was the only one who could talk to the flight spanders .
so i looked at them in a moment , and they said , " no problem , we probably caught some birds . "
the pilot had already applied the machine , and we weren ' t that far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot launched the machine after the hudson river .
that ' s usually not the route .
it turns off the engines .
imagine a soundless airplane .
and then he said three words - the most emotionalless words i ' ve ever heard .
he says , " ready for impact . "
i didn ' t have to talk to the crew anymore . i
i could see it in her eyes , it was terrible , life was over .
now i want to share you three things that i learned about me that day .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
we have this life plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to give a hand and didn ' t do it , all the fences i wanted to stretch , all the experiences i wanted to do and never did .
as i was thinking about it later , i came up with a phrase which says , " i ' m collect bad wines . "
because when the wine is there and the person is there , i open it up .
i never want to change anything in life anymore .
and that urgency , that goal , really changed my life .
the second thing that i learned that day - and that was when we failed the george washington bridge , pretty much around hair - i thought , man , there ' s one thing i really regret .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i was looking to get better in everything i tackle .
but in my humanity , i ' ve also given space to my ego .
and i regret the time that i ' d wasted for meaningless things with people who mean something .
and i thought thinking about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
and after that , i was thinking about it , i decided to remove negative energy from my life .
it ' s not perfect , but it ' s much better .
i no t arguing with my wife for two years .
it feels great .
i ' m not trying to be right anymore ; i choose to be happy .
the third thing i learned - and that is as the inner clock starts begins , " 15 , 14 , 13 , . "
you can see the water coming .
i said , " please fly in into the air . "
i don ' t want this thing to break down into 20 parts , as you know from documentaries . i
as we crash , i had this feeling of dying being human beings , is not terrifying .
it ' s like we ' re preparing our lives for .
but it was very sad .
i didn ' t want to leave ; i love my life .
and that sadness really formed in a thought , which is that i just only wish want one thing .
i just wish i could see my kids grow up .
about a month after that , i visited a my daughter s performance - first graders , not a lot of artistic talent .
. not yet .
and i celebrate , i cry like a little kid . and
and in the world , everything made a sense to me .
i realized at the time , by connecting the dots together , that life is all about being a great father . i .
more than anything , anything else , my only goal in life is to be a good father .
i was given the wonder miracle of not dying die that day .
i got another gift , which is to look in the future , and come back and live differently .
my call to everybody who flies fly today is , imagine the same thing happens on your flight - please don ' - but imagine about it ; and how would you change ?
what would you do that they put because they think they ' re there forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are you the best parents you can only possibly be ?
thank you . thank
the idea behind the stuxnet computer worm , itself is quite simple .
we don ' t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post there for developing nuclear weapons is the uranium enriction facility in nata .
the gray boxes that you see here , these are real - time control systems .
now , if we can comppula with the systems that control rotations and valves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge . now
these gray boxes don ' t run with windows software ; they ' re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can an effective windows virus take on a laptop that ' s used by a maintenance engineer to configure this gray box , we ' re in business . but .
and this is the planning behind stuxnet .
so we start with a windows dropper .
the user data is transferred into the gray box , damage the centrifuge , and the iranian nuclear program delays - commissioned is done .
this is a game , right ?
i want to tell you how we foundd this .
when we started our research at stuxnet six months ago , it was completely unknown clear what the purpose of this design was .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated about the windows part , the dropper part , it was used from thousands of zero - day flaws .
and it seemed to be happen something with these gray boxes , these real - time control systems .
this attracted our attention , and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with stuxnet , and we studied this structure .
and then something weird happened .
stuxnet was like a lab rat that didn ' t like our cheese - sniff on it , but didn ' t want to eat it .
that made no sense in my eyes .
and after experimenting with different kinds of cheese , i realized that this is a targeted attack .
completely focused at on a particular target .
the dropper actively tos around the gray box when ' discovered a special configuration has been discovered , even when the particular program that tries to infect it tries runs run on this target .
and if it doesn ' t , stuxnet doesn ' t do anything .
so , this really attracted me my interest , and we started working with it , almost 24 / 7 , because i thought , well , we don ' t know what the goal is . so
it could be , say , for example , a u . s . power plant or a chemical plant in germany . it
so we should figure out what the goal is .
so we extracted and deco the attack code , and found that it ' s structured into two digital warheads - a smaller one and a bigger one .
and we also noticed that they were very professionally designed by people who obviously had all the inside information available .
they knew all the bits and bits that they had to attack .
they probably knew the size of the machine operator .
so they knew everything .
and if you ' ve realizedd that the dropper from stuxnet is complex and high - tech , let me tell you , the user data is a science for yourself . and
it ' s much more sophisticated than anything we ' ve ever seen .
here ' s a glimpspt of this attack code .
we ' re talking about - about 15 , 000 lines of code .
it looks pretty much like old - fashioned code language .
and i want to tell you how we were able to get smarter from this code .
so the what we were was looking for was system function calls , because we know what they re doing do .
and then we looked for timers and data structures and tried to connect them to the real world - potential targets in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could prove or dis .
to order to set these theories , let ' s remember that it ' s definitely high - level counterage , it has to be a high - quality target , and very likely it ' s in iran , because where most infections have been reported there .
well , there aren ' not several thousand targets in this area .
it ' s basically going out to the bush nuclear power plant and the uranium ref plant in mumbai .
so i said to my assistant , " bring me a list of all the experts in centrifuge and power plants from our client . "
and i called them up and i taped their knowledge to compare their expertise to what we had found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , we were able to connect the little digital warhead with the rotor control .
the rotor is this moving part inside the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and if you manipulate the speed of this rotor , you ' re actually able to crack the rotor and eventually even blow the centrifuge . and
what we also found is that the goal of the attack was actually to make it happen slowly and scarrable - obviously , in trying to maintenance engineers desperate in so they couldn ' t be able to get quickly behind it quickly .
the big digital warhead - we got a glimpse from by looking very at data and data structures .
so for example , the number 164 proves very strong out from this code ; you can ' t miss it . so
i started working through scientific literature about how these centritrenes are built in nata , and found that they ' re structured in what we call cass , and each case contains 164 centrifuments . and
so that made sense , it fit together .
and it got even better .
these centrities in iran are divided into 15 so - called levels . these
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
it ' almost identical structure .
so again , that was really well .
and this gave us great confidence for what we were studying here .
now , don ' t get me wrong , it didn ' t just go that .
these results were achieved by several weeks of hard work .
and we often just ran into a dead end and had to gatherves .
anyway , what we found that both digital warheads were actually heading towards one the same target , but from different directions .
the little bombhead takes over a circuit , and flips the rotors and slows them , and the big warhead joins interacts with six circuits and manipulates valves . the
so , by and large , we ' re very confident that we ' ve actually determined what the goal is .
it ' s nata , and it ' s just titanic .
so we don ' t have to worry that other goals could be made by stuxnet .
here ' s something a really cool stuff that we discovered - really gotw me out .
down there is the gray box , and on top of it you see the centritrifucles .
now , what this thing does is it absors the input value of sensors - so for example , pressure sensors and vibration sensors - and it provides legitimate code that runs during the attack with false input data .
and in fact , this false data from stuxnet is already recorded before . and in
so it ' s just like in hollywood movies where during the shooting the surveillance camera is fed with previous recorded video footage .
that ' s cool , isn ' t it ?
the idea here obviously is not just overlap the machine users in the control room .
in fact , it ' s much more dangerous and more aggressive .
the idea is to overshforce a digital security system .
we need digital security systems where a human machine operator can ' react fast enough .
so for example in a power plant , if the big steam turbine gets too fast , you have to open load valve within milliseconds . so
of course , this cannot t be done by a human machine handler .
so at this point , we need digital security systems .
and if they ' re at risk , really bad things can happen .
the power plant can explode .
and neither the machine controller , nor the security system , will notice it .
this is frightening .
but it gets worse .
and what i ' m saying now is very important . and
think about it . this attack is generic .
it has nothing to do specifically with centrifuge , with uranium enriction . it
so for example it would work just as well - in a power plant or in a automobile factory .
it ' s generic .
and you don ' t have to - as the attacker - you don ' t have to put the user data through a usb key , as we saw in stuxnet . and
you could also use ordinary worm technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , eventually you get a cyber mass of mass destruction .
that ' s the consequence we have to face .
so unfortunately , the largest number of targets for these attacks are is not in the middle east .
they ' re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the most targeted environments .
we have to face the consequences , and we start better to prepare .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , there ' s been a lot of reported that people suspect that the mullad is the main organization behind it .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you really want to know ?
yeah . okay .
in i think the mossad is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force behind this is the cyber superpower .
there ' s only one , and this is the united states - fortunafully , fortunafully .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for chaseing us a lot . thank you ralph .
i ' ve spent the last few years putting in situations that are usually very difficult and at kind of dangerous at time .
i went to jail - difficult .
i worked in a coal mine - dangerous .
i filmed in war zones - difficult and dangerous .
and i ' ve spent 30 days eating anything but eating this - fun at the beginning , a little difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i ' ve been exposed most of my career to the seemingly for terrible situations , and all of it this just for trying to study explore social interests in a way that they ' re compaging and interesting and hopefully in a way understand what makes them fun and accessible to the audience .
so when i knew i was going to come here to look at the world of branding and sponsoring in a tedtalk , i knew i was going to do something a little different .
some of you may have heard about the posted an ad on ebay a few weeks ago .
i sent some facebook messages , some twitter messages , and i gave people the opportunity to create the names to my tedtalk in 2011 .
in fact , some happy people and companies , for - profit and non - profit , got the unique opportunity - because i ' m sure chris anderson will never going to let that again - to buy the name of the talk you ' re looking at right now , which at the time did not have a title or a lot of content , and not a lot of clues about what the subject would be . , in a of
so what you got was this : your name here : my tedtalk , which you have no idea what the subject was going to be , and which could ever it fly around your ears according to content , especially if i let your company standpid for participation stupid .
but besides that , it ' s a very good media opportunity .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot .
by the way , that is just the work title .
so despite this warning , i knew anybody would going to buy the names .
now , if you asked me this a year ago , i wouldn ' t have been able to tell you this sure .
but in the new project that i ' m working on , my new film , we look explore at the world of marketing , of advertising .
as i said , over the course the years i ' ve gone into some pretty terrible situations , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could save me to go for something as difficult and as dangerous as going a with these guys .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i want to do is a film about product placement , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by product placement , marketing and advertising .
and the movie will be called " the greatest movie ever sold . "
so what happens in " the greatest movie ever sold , " is that everything , from top to bottom , from the beginning to the end , is completely set brandsed - from the title you ' re going to see in the movie , which is the x . so
now this brand , the philadelphia stadium , the staples center .
these people will be connected to the film in eternal - forever .
and so the movie will explore this whole idea - that ' s what ? in eternity , forever ?
i ' m a redundant person .
that was more to emphasis .
it was " in eternity , forever . "
but not ' re not we going to have the brand x as a theme sponsor , but we ' re going to make sure we ' re going to sell any possible category in the movie . but
so maybe we can sell a shoe , and it will be the greatest shoe you ' ve ever worn .
the greatest car you ' ve ever drove from " the greatest movie ever sold , " the greatest drink you ' ve ever had , an attention from " the greatest movie ever sold . " the "
so the idea is , aside showing that brands are part of life , actually to get them to finance the movie ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you ' ll to see the whole thing in the movie going from places .
so that ' s the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to the end .
and i ' d be happy if ceg would help make this happen .
you know , it ' s funny because when i first heard it , it ' s the ultimate respect for the audience .
but i don ' t know how deli people are will to be . but
do you have a perspective - i don ' t want to use " perspective , " because that has a negative perspective - but you know how this is going to evolve ?
how much money is it take to do that ?
1 . 5 million .
i think it ' s hard to meet them , but i think it ' s definitely worth addressing some really known brands .
who knows , when the movie comes out , we might look like a tribe of idiots . who
what do you think the answer will be ?
the answer will be extremely likely to be no .
but is it a hard thing because of the movie or a difficult thing for me ?
jk : both .
so . so means , not so optimistic .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we have to think about what brands .
yeah .
if you look at the people they ' re to dealing deal with .
there are some places we can turn to .
put up the camera .
i thought , " put out the camera out " would mean that we wanted to have a background interview .
it turned out that it meant , " we don ' t want to have anything to do with your film . "
and that s all these companies disappeared , one after another .
nobody wanted to have anything to do with the movie .
i was amazed .
they wanted absolutely nothing to do with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising was to present your product to as many people as possible , make as many people as possible see . and
especially in the world today , at this intersection of new and old media and the fragmented media landscape - it ' s not the idea of be in this new exciting communication tool that the masses are bringing this message .
no , that ' s what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a fatal mistake , and that was this .
in no , that was t not the mistake at all .
that wouldn have been a problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture represents for is a problem .
see , if you type in transparency in the google search , this is - this is one of the first images that appears out .
i really like your way , sergey brin .
this was the problem : transparency - free of deception and floth , easy to discover and understand ; immediately understood ; characterized by visible and access to information , especially in terms of business practices - the last line is certainly the biggest problem . this
you know , we ' re hearing a lot about transparency right now .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceos say it .
but when it comes to be implemented , something changes .
but why ? now , transparency is fear suckening - like this strange bear who ' s still screaming .
it ' s unpredictable - like this strange highway .
and it ' s also very risky .
what else ' s risky ?
a whole dish of cool whip .
that ' s very risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , " no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . "
see , when i was a kid and my father caught me lie - and there he is sitting looking at me with this look - he would say , " my son , there are three versions in each story .
there ' s your version , there ' s my version , and there ' s the real version . "
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true real version .
but because only one company , an agency , was ready to help us - and because i ' ve known john bond and richard kirshenbaum for years - i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to deal the middleman and go to the companies with my team . but
so what they suddenly began to understand - or what i started began to understand - was is that when you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood is a broad problem .
i have friends making big , gigantic hollywood movies , and i have friends who making little independent movies like me .
and my friends making big , giantgantic hollywood movies say that the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners they have .
and then my friends who making small independent movies say , " well , how should we compete with these big , giantgantic hollywood movies ? "
and the film is called " the greatest movie ever sold . "
so how exactly are we going to see ban in the movie ?
every time i walk my way , and every time i open the medical cabinet , you ' ll see a deodorant .
and every time i interview someone , i can say , " are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you there ? you look a little nervous .
i want to help you calm down .
so maybe you should set a little bit of this before the interview . "
and then we offer one of these great fragrances .
either " floral fusion " or " paradise winds , " you ' ll have a choice .
we will going to be equipped for men and for women - solid , roll - on , or a stick , whatever .
this is the short story .
now i can answer all of your questions and give you a realial interpretation .
we ' re a smaller brand .
as you talked about the smaller movies , ' re a challenge as a brand .
so we don ' t have as a budget as other brands . so
so doing these things - you know , reminds people of ban - that ' s kind of why we ' re interested in .
what words would you describe meme ?
ban is blank .
that ' s a great question .
critical technology .
technology is not the way to describe something that someone is doing under your axes .
we ' re talking about bold , fresh .
i think " fresh " is a great word that really makes this category makes a positive , as opposed to , " fight smell and moisture . "
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them longer fresh - better fresh , more fresh , three times fresher . how
these things have a more positive effect .
and this is a million company .
what about me ? what about the desktop type ?
i have to talk to the man in the street who is like me , otto normal consumer .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmm , my brand ?
i don ' t know . i
i really like beautiful clothes .
' 80s revive meets skateboard , except on holiday day .
all right , what is the gerry brand ?
unique .
i think the style , the style i have is probably " dark glamour . "
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of gray areas and stuff .
but usually i have an accessory , like sunglasses , or a jewelry and stuff like that .
if dan was a brand , he would probably be a classic mercedes coupe .
the brand i am is , i would say , imagine fly .
part hippie , part yogi , part brooklyn girls - i don ' t know .
i ' m the jewelry type .
i sell spicery animals all over the country , around the world .
so i think that ' s my brand .
this is my brand in my little distorted industry .
my brand is fedex , because i were imports .
man : brand of fake alcohol addic writer .
is that be done ?
lawyer : i ' m a lawyer brand .
i ' m tom . i
now , we can ' t all be the tom brand , but i often see at the intersection of dark glamour and silous fly .
and what notice is was that i needed an expert .
i needed somebody who could get inside my head , somebody who could really help me understand what ' s called " brand personality . "
and so i found a company called olson zalman in pittsburg .
they ' ve helped companies like nestle , feppale , hallmark discover this brand .
if you could do it for them , you could probably help me too .
you they brought your pictures with me , right ?
that i have . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how this is related to your thoughts and feelings about you .
these are the people who shape my worldview . these
tell me about this world .
md : this world ? i think your world is the world that you live in - like the people around you , the friends , the family , the way you live your life , the work and so on .
all these things come and start from a place , and for me , come and they start with my family in west virginia .
what ' s the next thing you want to talk about .
next day . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what does that say to the thoughts and feelings about yourself ?
it ' s the what i d like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are strange . i like odd things .
tell me about the " why " phase - what does it get us ?
what is the machete ? what puppet stage are you in right now ?
why is it important to reboot ? what does the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about you , that ' not you .
what more metamorphosis did they go through ? what
- that doesn ' t have to be fear . what kind of rollercoaster are you in ?
ooee ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for your patience .
yeah . all right .
yes , i don ' t know what ' s going to happen of it .
there were a lot of crazy things going on .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their brand have two separate but complementalary pages - the morgan trawllock brand is a an meaningful / playful brand .
they complement very well .
and i think there ' s almost a contradiction with that .
and i think some companies will only focus on one strength , rather than both .
a lot of companies tend to - and this is human nature - to avoid things where they ' re not sure , they ' re going to avoid , these elements , and they welcome them , and they actually turn them into something positive for themselves , and that ' s a clever chess .
what other brands act like this ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can also see it here , target , wiii , mini from mini coopers and jetblu . and
now , there are playful brands and mindful brands , these things that come and go , but a playful , mindful brand is a pretty strong thing .
a mindful , playful brand . what is your brand ?
if somebody asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand personality , how about you ?
you call a up attribute ? are you something that makes the blood in wall ?
or are they more of a down attribute ?
are you something that is a little quieter , more reservedd , more conservative ?
up attutes are things that are playful , fresh like the fresh prince , her , adventurous , sad and lovely like erol flynn , agile and agile , profane , herrish , magical and mystical like gandalf .
or are they more like a down attribute ?
are you careful and moonan like 007 ?
are they established , traditional , care , protective , compassionate like oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , familiar , safe , safe , sacred , thoughtful like the dalai lama or yoda ?
over the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies who were up and down companies and who said " no , " because they didn ' t want to part of the project .
most of them they didn wanted to have to do with this film because they had no control , no control over the finished product .
but there will find 17 brand partners who were willing to avoid this control , who wanted to do business with someone as careful and playful as i did , and that eventually em eventuallypower us to tell stories we wouldn ' t normally have tell - stories an adiser would never support . but .
they empowered us to tell the story of neuromarkting , just as we tell the story in this film , that today we use mris to explore the pleasure centers of the brain , both to make advertising and make movies .
we went to sao paulo , where foreign ad has been banned .
all throughout across the city , five years ' s been found no ad , no poster , no posters , nothing .
and we go to school districts where companies are going their way to impoverished schools , all across america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i got the most feedback from , or where i had the biggest success , are the where i interacted with things directly . the
and that ' s what these brands have done .
because they went around the middleman , they went around the agencies , and they said that maybe the agencies don ' t really have their interest in mind .
i ' m going totiate with the artist directly .
i ' m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that makes people think that our worldview challenges . i
and what was that for them ? what was it successful ?
now , since the film first launches at sundance film festival , we can look at this .
according to burrelles , the premiere was in january , and since then - and this is s not even the whole thing - there were 900 million views from this film .
this is actually only a two a two weeks . this
this is just online - no press , no tv .
the film hasn ' t yet been released yet .
it ' t even exist online . there ' s no streaming . it
he hasn ' t come out of other countries .
well , after all , the film has gained a very large momentum .
and that ' s not bad for a project where almost every adiser agency we talked to has recommended their clients to let their fingers go .
one of the things that i believe in is that when you take your chance , you take risks , that aresibilities in those risks .
i think if you prevent people from doing it , you get them closer to failure .
i think that if you train your employees to avoid risks , you prepare the whole company to make a profit .
i feel that as we move forward , we need encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people not to be afraid about possibilities that might scare .
finally , as we move forward , we should welcomed fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
welcome the fear . welcome the risk .
each a big spoon full , we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , brings us a little bit of honesty .
and that says , with honesty and transparency , my whole talk , " what welcome me transparency , " was presented to you by my good friends at emc who paid $ 71 , 000 for the name on ebay . and . and
big data is being turned into big opportunities for organizations around the world .
emc presents : " welcome transparency "
thank you . thank
now , morgan , in the name of transparency this , what happened to the $ 71 , 000 ?
that ' s a great question .
i bought a check in my pocket issued to the head organization of the ted organization , the sapling foundation - a check 71 , 000 dollars to fund my ted performance the next year . i
my name is amit .
18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i started to do something with museums and art , and my ceo , who ' s today , gave me the green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i ' m going to focus on the show .
there ' s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple explained with this slide and access .
i grew up in india .
i was given a great education - i ' m not complaining - but i had no access to many museums and these works .
when i went and to these museums , i started learning a lot .
and while i was working for google , i tried to bring this desire - make art more accessible - with technology .
we then formed a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i ' m probably going to start with the demonstration and tell you some interesting things that have happened since the launch . i
so you just go to google artproject . com .
you can look around all these museums here .
there ' s the uffizi , the moma , the hermita , the rijks , the van gogh . there
in fact , i get into one of my favorites , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get in two ways - very simple .
click , and boom , you ' re in this museum .
it doesn ' t matter where you are - bombay , mexico , it doesn ' t make any difference . it .
you go around and you ' re enjoying .
you want to orient in the museum ?
open the map , and jump with a click .
they ' re in there , they want to get up to the end of the gang .
just keep on going . lots of fun .
poke .
thank you , but the best part is .
so now i ' m in front of one of my favorite pictures , the harvester worker by pieter brueugel at the met . so
i see this pluse .
if the museum gave us the picture , click on it .
so this is one of the images .
these are all the metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here - but i ' ll click this away now .
this is one of the images that we ' ve taken with what ' s called the gigapix technology .
for example , this image picture has about 10 billion points , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , " what do you get for 10 billion points ? "
i ' m going to show you this now . i
you can zoom in and out very easily .
you see something funny here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
but then they really want to really deep .
and so i started playing around , and i realized something was going on there .
and i thought , " wait a minute , that sounds interesting . "
i went close , and i slowly realize that these kids were actually beat something .
i research a little research , talked to some friends at the met , and i actually found out that it ' s a game called squail , where a geese on gets with a stick on christmas . i
it seemed was quite popular .
i don ' t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to get really close , you can go up to the cracks .
just to give you a sense , i zoom out so you can see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best one comes - in a second .
let ' s jump up to moma quickly , again in new york .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
the previous example was about finding details .
but what if you want to see the brushs ?
and what ' s when you want to see how van gogh created this masterpiece ?
you zoom in . you can really go in .
i ' m going to zoom in one of my favorite parts of this picture until i ' m really on the cracks . i
this is star night , probably never seen this before . this
now i ' m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many more , but i don ' t have time . there
that ' s the really cool part , it ' s called collections .
every of you , everybody - whether rich or poor , whether you have a great house - doesn ' t matter .
you can go and create your own museum online - from all these images , you can set your own collection .
very simply , you go in - and i ' ve created this , which ' is called the power of the zoom - you can zoom around .
this is " the sent , " in the national gallery .
you can put everything in comments , send to your friends , and there s a conversation start about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think finally , the main thing for me that all the wonderful things here don ' t come from google .
they ' t even come out of the museums , i think .
maybe i should not say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope we will deal with this digital medium of art , and represent it properly online .
and the biggest question i ' m asked recently is , " did you do this to replicate the experience of a museum visit ? "
the answer to that is no .
it ' s supposed to add the experience .
that ' s what it is . thank you .
thank you .
this is a picture of your brain . your brain can be divided into two halves .
that ' s the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the aps of each hemisphere , we could represent their brain .
for example , this would be somebody who is completely logical .
this would be somebody who ' s completely intuitive .
now , where would you position your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have chosen for one of these extremes , but i think for most people in the audience , your brain looks something like this - with a high aphetic that ' s the same time in both hemispheres .
it ' s not as if they ' re both exclusive or anything like that .
they can be logical and intuitive .
and so i see myself as one of the people , along with most other experimental quantum physicists who need a good amount of logic to put the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good amount of intuition to actually do the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love playing with things .
so we go out and we play with it and then we look see how it reactss , and then we start developing our intuition there .
they basically do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that they ' ve developed over the years is probably that a thing can only be in one place at the same time .
i mean , it can sound strange to think that a thing is at the same time in two different places , but they were not born with this idea ; they developed it .
i remember seeing a kid playing on a ground .
he was still a child , and he wasn ' t very good at it , and he was kept fell down . he .
but i bet playing with the ground floor taught him a very valuable lesson , which is that big things don ' t just let you , and they stay in one place .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , as long as you ' re not a particle physicist .
it would be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they don ' t play with ground waveress , they play with these little strange particles . it .
and when you play with their particles , they find all kindss of weird things - like fly directly through walls , or that at the same time they can be in two different places at .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called them the theory of quantum mechanics .
that was the state of physics a few years ago ; it needed quantum mechanics to describe the small , tiny particles .
but they didn ' t need them to describe the great everyday objects around us .
this didn ' t like my intuition , and maybe ' s because i don ' t play with particles so often . this
well , i play with them , but not very often .
and i ' ve never seen them .
i mean , no one has ever seen a particle .
but my logical side didn ' t like it either .
because if all these things are made of particles and all these particles follow the rules of quantum mechanics , shouldn ' t just everything follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don ' t see a reason why it should ' t be that way .
so i ' would feel much better with the whole thing if we could somehow show that everyday objects also follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so a few years ago , i set to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that was in quantum mechanical superposition .
so what we ' re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal i ' m going to talk about in a moment .
this is a picture of the object .
here i ' m getting a little bit . we ' re looking right in the center .
and here ' s a really big close - up of this little piece of metal .
so what we ' re looking at is a little piece of metal , it ' s shaped like a jumpboard , and it ' s falling over the edge . so
so i did this thing in a similar same way where you make a computer chip . so
i went into a clean room with new silicon sl , and i crawd all the big devices for 100 hours .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine - to get this hole shaped like a swimming pool and this thing .
this thing has the ability to be in the quantum mechanical superposition , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , when i ' m alone in the elevator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people come in , and i stop doing all these things , because i don ' t want to bother them , or , frankly , scar you .
so quantum mechanics says that unseen objects feel the same way .
the riders for static objects are not just people , but also the light that shines on them and the wind that sweeps past them and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal bee quantum mechanically behaving , we had to out all the visitors out . and
and that ' we did .
we turned off the lights , we put it in a vacuum , and we sucked out all the air and cooled it almost to the now , alone in the elevator , that piece of metal was free to behave as it wanted .
so we measured his movement .
we found that it ' s moving really strangely .
instead of it just lying stillly there , it vibrated . the way it vibrateted was kind of like this - like a expanding and internecing bubble gum .
by giving him a little push , we could make it to vi and not vibrate at the same - time - something that is only allowed in quantum mechanics .
so what i ' m telling you right now is something truly fantastic .
what does it mean for an object to vibrate the same time not to vibrate at the same time ?
let ' s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion of atoms that piece of metal made of are still there , and at the same time the same atoms are moving up and down . so
only at precise time that they agree .
for the rest of the time , they ' ve been delozed .
that means that each atom is the same in two different places same time , which at the same time that the entire piece of metal is in two different places .
i think that ' s really cool .
really .
that was worth me in the clean room for this year , because check this , the mass difference between a single atom and that piece of metal is about as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , that piece of metal can be in two different places , why not you ? so
i mean , that ' s just what my logical side says .
so , imagine you were in multiple places at the time , what would that feel like ?
how would your consciousness deal with your body being delokalized in the room ?
there ' s another aspect to history .
when we warmed it up , we turned the lights on , and we looked at the box in , we saw that piece of metal was always there in one piece .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are put together in a small room . and
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says everything is connected to everything .
well , that ' s not quite right .
there ' s even more to it , it s goes even deeper .
so it ' s that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that ' s the profound and strange thing of quantum mechanics .
thank you . thank
in 2007 , i decided that we should re -inti the way we think about economic development .
what our goal is that , if families think about where they want to live and work , they ' re given them the opportunity to choose between at least one handful of different cities all competing for new residents .
right now , we ' re far from this target .
there are billions of people in the developing world that who don ' t even have a single city that they would welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they are re worth so much more than it costs to them to build .
so we could design the world very easily with hundreds , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
now this may sound absurd to you , if you ' ve never thought about new cities .
just trade the building of apartments against the building of cities .
imagine half of the people who want to live in apartments have already done that ; half other half of don ' t yet .
they could try and expand the capacity of existing apartments .
but you know what you ' d be involved into these apartments and their environment have to avoid complaints and to distract from development .
so it turns out it ' s very hard to get go with all these extensions .
but you could go to a whole new place , build a whole new block of , unless that the laws there would support a building like this and not inhipress it . but
so i proposed that governments would create new spaces that provide enough space for a city , and given them a name : charter cities .
later , i found that about the same time , javier and octavio were thinking about the challenge of reform in honduras .
they knew that every year about 75 , 000 honduras leave their country year to travel to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people could stay in their country and do the same in honduras .
at this point , javier said to octavio , " what happens if we take an uninhabited area of our country - what if we just give it a message - a part of the american message ; part of the canadian embassy - and if people want to go to work under the canadian rules or the united states , can they work there , and they can do on the area of these messages everything they would have to go to canada or america ? "
in the summer of 2009 , honduras suffered a severe constitution crisis . in
in the next plan elections , pepe lobo a shift whose program offered both novelty and simtion .
he asked octavio to become his chief .
in the meantime , i prepared for a talk at tedglobal .
by improving , trying , and by studyinggating consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of charter city to the key elements .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that govern you cannot ' t disrupt existing housing owners .
we pay a lot of attention to new technologies , but progress it requires technologies and laws to progress , and it ' s usually laws that keep us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from guatemala sent octavio sent the link to the tedtalk .
again , he showed him javier .
the two called me .
and they said , " let ' s present this to the leader of our country ! "
so we met in december in the auditorium of a hotel in miami .
i tried to figure clear out how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and i used this graph to show how valuable rawland is in a place like new york . remember in some cases is worth thousands of dollars per a square meter . and
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at a point when there was a pause , octavio said , " paul , maybe we could look at the tedtalk . "
so the tedtalk argued , in a very simple form , that a charter city is a place whose beginning is uninhabited land , an founding contract that sets the laws that exist there and gives people the opportunity to choose decide either to live under those rules or not .
so i was asked by the president of honduras who said that we need to do this project , that it ' s important , and that this is the way to move our country forward . so
i was asked to come to tegugalpa and give a talk again on the fourth and fifth of january .
so i gave another facts pack talk that which contains a graph like this , which tries to illustrate that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city of denver , and the sketch shows the new airport that built in denver .
these airport alone has 100 square kilometers across .
so i tried to convince the honduras , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with an area of at least 1 , 000 square kilometers . so
that ' s more than 250 , thousand days .
politely , everybody applaud .
the audience ' s faces were very serious and alert .
the president of congress came up on the stage and said , " professor romer , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i have it on my laptop . "
so i sat down , and they were playing the tedtalk .
and i ' ve come to the core statement that a new city gives new opportunities to people .
there would be the possibility opportunity to live in a city that would be in honduras , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north . there
and a new city also includes new opportunities for leaders .
the leaders of the government in honduras dependd on the help of partner countries , they could benefit from their partners countries that they would support in setting the laws for this charter and implement the this , that everybody can trust that the charter is really implemented .
and the realization of president lobo was that the certainty of leadership i ' ve been thinking about as a way to get foreign investors come and build this city be equally equivalent to all the parties in honduras who have been suffered suffering from fear and mistrust for many years . and
we went to an area .
this picture is of this place .
it easily a thousand square kilometers .
and shortly after that , january 19th , they voted for a change in the constitution to have a constitutional policy that is allowed for specific development areas .
in a country that has just had a severe crisis , 125 voted to in congress for this amendment with 124 was voted . in
all parties , all parties of society , supported this .
but to be part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice by congress twice .
on february 17th , it was approved for the second time with 114 to a voice .
right after this that election , between february 21 and february 24th , a delegation of about 30 dog mcdonalds traveled to the two places in the world that were most interested in entering into the of urbanism .
the one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a large new city built in south korea - bigger than the city of boston . this .
everything you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the permissions .
the other place that was very interested in urbanism is singapore .
there have already two cities built in china already , and the third is in preparation .
so if you think about it basicallyly , it ' s where we are today .
they already have a construction site , and they ' re already consider considering this area for the second city .
it ' s already working on a legal system that allows managers to participate , and it ' s also being working on an external legal system .
a country has already offered to provide its supreme court as a court for the disent appeal of the judicial system there .
urban designers and farmers are very interested .
they even bring funding money .
one of the things , as you already know , has been solved , there are a lot of tenants .
there are a lot of businesses that who would like to move in america , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there ' s a lot of people who would like to live there . there
there are 700 million people around the world who say that they would like to live in a different place permanently .
a million people year leave latin america every year and migrate to the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to leave their families to look for work - sometimes they ' re single mothers who have to make enough money to afford food and clothing .
unfortunately , sometimes it ' s even children trying to find their parents that they , in some cases , have haven ' t seen for a decade . and
so what is it an idea to think about building a whole new city in honduras ?
or even building dozen of these cities , or hundreds of them around the world ?
so what is it an idea to insist that each family has an a choice between multiple cities competing with new residents ?
that ' s an idea worth spreading .
my friends from honduras asked me to say , thank you ted .
do you know how many decisions you make on a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
i recently did a survey of over 2 , 000 americans , and the average number of choices that makes a typical american on a day is 70 .
and also , a study recently with ceos where they watching the ceos for a week .
and these scientists just documented the different topics that these ceos dealing with , and how much time they spent making decisions relate to the topics .
and what they found is that an average ceo 139 tasks a week .
each of these topics , of course , consisted of many and lots of smaller decisions . each of
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
only took for about 12 percent of their your decisions it they took an hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions do you make in the nine minutes category versus those in the one hour category ?
how well do you think are you in dealing with the decisions ?
today i want to talk about one of the biggest decision - making problems of our modern time , the decision - making problem .
i want to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i ' m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers . now
if i ask you a question , raise , because i ' m blind , just raise your hand if you want to burn a some calories .
otherwise , i ask you if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question for today is : are you willing to hear about the decision - making problem ?
thank you . thank
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very exclusive foodocery store ; at least the time it was really exclusive .
it was a store called sloaner ' s .
this business , it was almost like an pleasureusement park .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and soy and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water - and that was at a time when we actuallynk drinking water . they
i loved to go to this business , but at a point i asked myself , well , how come you never buy anything ?
here ' s the olive oil gang .
they had over 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those ones that were locked in boxes that came from thousands thousand of years - old olive trees .
so one day i went to theoce store , and i asked the leiter , " does this model work that they really give people all these pos opportunities ? "
and he showed at the bus calls of tourists who would came every day and usually had their cameras with them .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose soap for our experiment .
here ' s her flame walking .
they had 348 different kinds of marble .
we set up a little store box right at the entrance of the store .
we put six different flavors of soap or 24 different flavors of soap there , and we looked at two things : one , in which case would more people stay stop and try pepper ?
there more people have left when they were 24 , about 60 percent than if it were six , about 40 percent .
and after that , we looked at which case people more buy a glass of marble .
now we saw the reverse effect .
of the people who stopped when they were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a glass of soda .
of the people who stopped when they were six , well , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of soda .
now , if you do the , people bought six times more of a glass of marble if who they had six to choose than if they had 24 to choose .
now , choosing not to buy glass of mica is probably good for us - at least it ' s good for our wai - but it turns out that the decision - making problem also affects us in very successful decisions .
we don ' t decide choose to decide , even when it comes against our own best interests .
so the theme of the day : financial savings .
now i ' m going to describe you a study that i did with gur huberman , emir kamenica , wei jang , where we looked at the decisions of savings for the retirement of almost a million americans from about 650 plans in the united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of offers that could be possible to on a pension savings plan , the 401 plan , affect the probability whether more saved for tomorrow . and
and what we found was that actually there was actually a connection .
so in these plans , we had about 65 ,7 plans that offered people something between two to 59 different funds .
and what we found was that the more funds were offered , in fact , the participation was lower .
now , if you look at the extremes , the plans that two funds offered , had a participation rate in the ' 70s - still not as high as we want .
in the plans that offered nearly 60 funds , the participation rate now dropped to about the 60 percentage .
now it turns out that even if you decide to participate , if there were more options of choice , even then it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate tend to that the more opportunitiessi they were available , the more they avoiding stocks and funds .
the more opportunities they were available , the more they put all their money into just money market accounts .
none of these extreme decisions are one among of the decisions that any of people would recommend if we care about their future financial well - being .
now , in the last 10 years , we ' ve seen three major negative consequences in humans that leads providing more and more choices .
they make the decision - put it up , even if it comes against their own best interest .
they make worse decisions - worse financial decisions and worse medical decisions .
they choose for things that they re less satiied themselves , even if they make it more objectively better .
the main reason for this is that maybe we might enjoy lookinging at these giant shelves full of lemonade , mustard , olive and oliveade , but we essentially can ' t draw the comparisons and the distinctions and then actually choose something out of the fantastic supply .
so what i want to suggest to you today is four simple techniques - techniques that we ' ve tested in different ways and in different research places - that you can just apply in your business .
first of all , limit .
you ' ve heard it before , but it ' s never more true than today that less is more . you
people are always worried when i say , " limit . "
they ' re always worried they ' re losing a shelfs .
but in fact , we ' re seeing it more and more that if you ' re willing to limit , and the irrelevant identical possibilities go of off , well , there ' s a rise in sales , there ' s reduced cost goes down , & amp ; and there ' s a improvement in decision - perception . but .
when proctor and gamble reduced the different head and - shoulder types from 26 to 15 , they saw a increase in sales by 10 percent . when
when the golden cat corporation broke rid of 10 worst sold cat , they saw that the profits went up 87 percent - a result of both of , the rise of sales and the reduction in cost .
you know , the average supermarket today offers you 45 , 000 products .
a typical walmar mart today offers you 100 , 000 products today .
but the ninth largest supermarket , which today ninth largest supermarket in the world , is aldi , and they only offer you 1 , 400 products - a kind of tomato sauce in cans . but
now in the world of saving , i think one of the best examples that have recently come out about how to best manage choices , was something that david laibson contributed a very lot involved in , which is a program offered at harvard .
every single harvard employee now automatically participate in a life time fund .
those who really want to make a choice are offered 20 funds , not 300 or more funds .
you know how people often say , " i don ' t know how to limit it .
it are all important possibilities . "
and the first thing i ask the employee question is , " tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if your employees can ' t separate them apart , their customers can ' t . "
now , before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he was ready to provide all the people in this audience an all - including paid vacation to the most beautiful street in the world .
here ' s a description of the road .
and i ' d like to read them you .
and now i ' m going to give you a few seconds to read them , and then i ask you to clap when you ' re ready to accept gary ' s offer . and
okay . anyone who ' s willing to accept gary ' s offer .
are they all ?
all right , let me show you a little more of that .
they knew there was a trick there , right ?
now , who ' s ready for this journey . ?
i think maybe i ' ve heard more hands .
all right .
in fact , you looked objectively at , you had more information for the first time than the second time , but i would dare to guess you they felt it more real for the second time .
because the images made it feel more real to them .
which brings me to the second technology that helps you deal with the problem of decision - making , which is s concreteization .
it ' s about that , in order to understand the difference between possibilities , people need to understand what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that those consequences need to be vivid and concrete felt .
why do people spend on 15 to 30 percent more when they use a ec card or a credit card than they do with cash ?
because it doesn ' t not really feel real money .
and it turns out that if you make something really feels , it ' s a very good tool to get people to save more .
so in a study that i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro previtero , we did a study with the people at ing - employees who are all worked for ing - and these people were all at a gathering where they signed their participation on their retirement savings plans . so . so
and during this gathering , we kept this gathering just the as it has always been , but we added a little bit .
the little thing that we added it was that we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they save money .
in we did this simple thing , there was a increase in participation by 20 percent , and there was a increase in the number of people who were willing to save , or a increase four percent increase in the amount they were willing to pay for the savings account .
the third technology : categorization .
we can better deal with more categories than we can with more choices .
for example , here ' s , a study we did in a magazine .
it turns out that in the wegman ' s supermarkets at the and down in the northeast area , it varies the number between 331 different kinds of magazines up to 664 magazines . it
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines and i put them into 10 categories , or i show you 400 magazines , and i put them into 20 categories , you think i ' ve given you more choice and a better selection experience when i gave you the 400 than if i had gave you the 600 . if . if . if .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
here are two different jewelry boxes .
one is called jazz , and the other one is called swing . one
if you think that the left display is swing and the ad on the right is jazz , you clap your hands .
okay , there ' s a few .
if you think that the ' s jazz on the left is jazz and the one is jazz on the right is , please clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they ' re right .
the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is swing , but you know what ?
this is a highly underutiessazed categorization set .
the categories have to tell the winner something not who the choice provides .
and you see this problem when you look at the long lists of all these funds .
who do you really want to inform about that ?
my fourth technology : the conditione of complexity .
it turns out that we can actually deal with more information than we think we just need to do is simplify it .
we need to slowly increase complexity .
i ' m going to show you an example of what i mean . i
let ' s take a very , very complicated decision : buying a car .
here ' s a german car manufacturer that allows you the opportunity to fullyfigure your car completely .
you have to make 62 different decisions to design your car completely .
now these choices differ in the number of choices you offer each choice .
car color , outside color of the car - i have 56 possibilities .
motors , gears - four possibilities .
what i ' m doing now is i ' m changing the order in which the decisions appear .
half of the customers go from the many possibilities , 56 car colors to the low possibilities , four gears .
the other half of the customers go from the low possibilities , four gears , to the 56 car colors , many possibilities .
what do i look at ?
how interested you are ? .
if you always use the standard choice on the decision , that means you ' re overwhelmed , which means , i ' m lose it .
what they find is that the people who go from the many to the low choices always and choose the standard choice over and over again .
we lose them .
if you go from the low - choices to the many , stay there it .
it ' s the same information . it ' s the same number of possibilities . it
the only thing i ' ve done is i change the order in which this information is presented .
when i start with the simple one , i learn how to i choose .
even though the gear , doesn ' t tell me about my preferences in the interior , it still makes me to choose .
it also gets me excited about the big product that i ' m putting together , and so i ' m willing to encourage myselfate to be with interest in it .
let me wrap up .
i ' ve told you about four techniques that minimize the problem of decision - making - limit - get rid of the unnecry alternatives ; concreteize - make it real ; categorize - we can better deal with more categories , fewer opportunitiesbilities , prepare for complexity .
each of these techniques that i describe to you today is designed meant to help you manage the possibilities - good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for the people you provide service .
because i think that the key to the best choice is that you ' re you choose randomy when choose choice .
and the more we are selective in choice , the better we ' re going to be able to practice the art of choice . and
thank you . thank
hi . i ' m kevin allocca , trends manager at youtube . i watch youtube videos .
that ' s true . that .
today we want to talk about how videos becomes viral , and then why it important at all .
we all want to be stars - celebrityties , singers , comedians - when i was young , it seemed so infinitely difficult .
but web video have allowed us to all , or all of our creative activities to become incredibly famous in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous by the internet until next saturday .
but on youtube , more than 48 hours of video per minute are uploaded .
again , only a tiny percentage of will ever becomes viral and is seen at thousands of times and so on the cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : tastemaker , participation organizations and the unexpected .
well , let ' s go .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
whoa !
ohh , woww !
last year , bear vasquez sent this video he had filmed outside of his house in yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it had seen 23 million times .
this graph shows what it looked like when the video first popular last summer .
actually , didn ' want to do a viral video . chris
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you do that when you ' re called yosemite mountain bear .
he hadloaded a lot of natural videos .
and this video had actually been broadcast in january .
what has happened here ?
there was jimmy kimmel .
jimmy kimmel sent the tweet that eventually made the video so popular .
because tastemakers like jimmy kimmel introduce us new and interesting things and show them to a big audience .
it ' s friday , friday . gotta get down on friday . everybody ' s looking forward to the weekend , weekend . friday , friday . gettin ' down on friday . you didnn ' t think we ' d going to have this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
rebecca black ' s " friday " is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was seen almost 200 million times this year .
this is what the chart looked like .
just like " double rainbow , " it seems to have out of nowhere .
what happened that day ?
well , it was friday , that ' s right .
if you want to know , these other peakss are also fridays .
but what about that day , that particular friday ?
well , tosh . 0 opened it up , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
michael j . nelson at the mystery science theater was the first person to make a joke on twitter .
what ' s important is that a single person or group of tasters took a point , shared with a large audience , and accelerated the process . what
then this community of people who shared this great inside joke and started talking about it and playing around with it .
now there are 10 , 000 partions of " friday " on youtube .
in the first seven days , there was a partion for every single week .
unlike the one way the 20th century , community participation ' s community is our way to become part of this phenomenon - either by spreading it or making something new out of it .
" nyan cat " is animation and music in endless loop .
it ' s it , very simple .
this year , it ' s seen almost 50 million times .
and if you think that ' s crazy , you should know that there ' s a three - hour version of this that ' s been seen four million times . and
even cats watch this video .
cats look at cats watching this video .
what important matters is the creativity that in the internet culture of techies and geeks . what
there were remixes .
somebody made an old - fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole remix community shooting out of the ground that made it from being a stupid joke to something we can all participate in .
today , we don ' t just find pleasure of something , we go with it .
who could have predictedated that this ?
who could have predicted " double rainbow " or rebecca black or " nyan cat ?
what scripts writers could you have written in which this is in ?
in a world where two days of video is uploaded every minute , can only spark really unique and unexpected as the videos we i ' mentioned about .
i admit i wasn ' t very interested when a friend told me to watch this great video about a guy protesting in new york for bicycles .
i got a ticket because i haven ' t been on the bike , but often there are difficulties that ' t let you properly walk on the bike .
because this was completely surprising and humorous , casey was nonnieskner ' s funny idea and his argument was at five million times .
this approach is true of everything new we do creatively .
and all of this leads to the one big question .
what does that mean ? .
ohh .
what does that mean ? .
tastemakers , creative participants , completely unexpected , are the features of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to and in which the audience determine popularity .
as i said , one of the biggest stars - justin bison - started on youtube .
nobody has to give the green light on their ideas .
and today we all feel as the owners of our pop culture as well .
and these are not the features of old media , and they hardly meet today ' s media , but they ' re going to determine the entertainment of the future .
thank you . thank
how can i talk 10 minutes about the connection between women across three generations , and how the amazing strength of that connection manifested itself in the life of a four - year - old girl when she was sat sitting bed with her little sister , her mother and her grandmother , in a small boat in the chinese sea , a connection that was stuck embedded in life this little girl ' s and never disappeared - this little girl who now lives in san francisco and speaks to you today ? how ? how - this girl who
the story isn ' t over yet .
it ' s a puzzle that ' s still being put together .
i want to tell you about some of the pieces of puzzle .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his life work .
he ' s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life was held together by the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home .
keep him with the invasion of the communists in sai as he has to admit that his life had been a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , were boiling with his .
he retreat into silence .
he died , broken by history .
he ' s my grandfather .
i ' ve never personally met him .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
i had to make sure it wasnn ' t for free , and my job was to learn that the story was trying to crush us , but we survived it . i .
the next piece of the puzzle shows how a boat goes quietly out on sea in early the morning .
my mother may was 18 when her father died - already in an arranged marriage , already with two little girls .
for her , life had asked a task : her family ' s escape and a new life in australia .
it was completely excluded that she could fail in this .
after a four - year old and film - watching saga , a boat lay still on onto the sea as a fishing boat scouged .
all adults were aware of the risks .
they most scar they were of pirates , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother carried a little poison bottle with her .
in a prisonertivity , my sister and i , then had themselves and my grandmother drank it .
my first memories are from this boat - the continuous sharing of the engine , the clapping of every wave on the front , the vast and empty horizon .
i don ' t remember the pirates who came come many times , but they were fool by the death of the men on our boat , or the crash of the engine that who didn ' t want to start six hours .
but i remember the lights of the oil platform off the malay coast , and the young man who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first apple that one of the men gave on the platform . but .
no apple has ever tasted that again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we ended up in melbourne .
and the next piece of puzzle is about four women in three generations building a new life together . and
we settled up down in footscray , is a populated by the working - class whose population is made of immigrant generations of immigrants .
unlike in the old - fashioned middle - class suburbs whose existence was completely known to me , footsc there was no .
the smells from the shop doors came from the rest of the world .
and the fats of broken english were traded between people who had one thing in common : they started .
my mother worked on farms , then on a assembly line in a car factory , six days , double layers .
she somehow found the time to learn english and it qualifications .
we were poor . we
every dollar was assigned and put into another education for english and math no matter whatever we had to give . most of the time these were new things that they were always from secondhand .
two few barsks for school , each one , to cover the holes in the other .
a school uniform up to the toeghs , because it had to last six years .
and there were the rare but painful choirs of " sl -ders " and here and were murals : " asias , go home . "
home where ?
something stuck inside me .
there was a meeting for reconciliation , and a quiet voice said , " i ' m going to get out of your way . "
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we talk told each other about our day , and we listened to the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered from nightmares off the boat .
and my job was to stay awake every night until their nightmares came , so i could wake them up .
she opened a computer business , then went cosmetic education and then opened another business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don ' t tole the change , angry and ineffi and sord children trapped between two worlds .
loans and sponsors were searched .
centers have been built .
i lived in parallel worlds .
in one , i was the classic asian student who offered unssatkabless demands on himself .
in the other , i was involved in unsecure lives carrying tragic scars of violence , drug abuse and insulation .
but so many have been help over the years .
and because of this help , i was selected in my last year of law school as a young australian of the year . and
and i was taken from one puzzle to the another catapult , and the edges didn ' t fit together . and
tan le , anonymous residents of footscray , was now tan le , refugee and social activist who was invited to speak to places she had never heard of and in homes she could never imagined existence .
i wasn ' t not familiar with the label .
i didn ' t know how to use the brck .
i didn ' t know how to talk about wine .
i didn ' t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the convenience of the life of an unknown suburb - a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who have been closed every each of their days as for 20 years by telling the stories of their day and writing , we still sleep in the same bed . i
i told my mother i couldn ' t do it .
she reminded me that i was as old as she her did when we climbed the boat .
no had never been an possibility .
" just do it , " she said . " and don ' not be what you ' re not . "
so i talked about youth unemployment and education , and the neglection of the marginalized and disenfraned . so
and the more open i talked , the more i should talk .
i met people in all the life , so many of them did what they loved , lived at the limits of the possible .
and even though i graduated from degree , i realized that i couldn ' t deal a career in law school .
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
and i realized , at the same time , that it ' s okay to be an outsider , a newcomer , new in the picture - and not just okay , but something you have to be grateful for , maybe a gift of the boat . and
because listening contributing can so easy to the collapse of the objects can mean so easy that you accept the assumptions of the environment .
i ' ve gone enough out of my conveni range to know that , yes , the world is divergen apart , but not the way you worry .
pos opportunitiesbilities that had not been allowed were explicitly encouraged .
there was an energy , an unsreskable optimism , a strange mixture of humility and man .
so i followed my gut reaction .
i collected a little team of people around me for whom the box " can ' t go " was an compelling challenge .
for a year , we didn ' t have a cent .
at the end of every day , i cooke served a giant pot of soup that we shared .
we worked late at night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but there were some brilliant ones at it , and we made the breakthrough .
i made a decision to go to the united states .
after just one trip there .
my gut feeling again .
three months later , i had moved , and the adventure continued on .
before i close the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when confuziaism was the social norm and local mandarin was the most important person .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died just after she was born .
her mother raised her alone .
at 17 , she became the second woman of a mandarin whose mother beat her .
without the support of her husband , she sparked a sensation by bringing him to court and being a chargeser in her own case , and an even bigger sensation than she won .
" don ' t go " turned to be false .
i was bathing in a hotel room in sydney when she died 1 , 000 miles away in melbourne . i
i looked through the shower window and saw them standing on the other side .
i knew she had come to say goodbye .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in footscray , and we sat around their sarg .
we told her stories , and assured her we were still with her .
around midnight , the monk came and said he had to close the cogassum .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , " why is her hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? "
" because they ' ve keeping them this morning , " he said .
" they didn ' t let them go . "
if there ' s a band in our family , it goes through the women .
if you can see who we were and how life shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives had come in the way .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i ' d like to have my own kids , and i ' m still thinking of the boat .
who would ever wish one ?
yes , i ' m afraid of privilege , of ease , of legi .
can i give you a bug in your life that res braveists every wave , the unwanted , continuous shucks of the engine , the long horizon that doesn ' t guarantee anything ?
i don ' t know . i
but if i could give this and make it safe through , i would do it .
also , tan ' s mother is also here in the fourth or fifth row . and
i ' m here to share my photography with you .
is it photography at all ?
because this , of course , is a picture you can ' t capture with your camera .
yet , my interest in photography began when i got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
i combined it with my previous preference for drawing , but it was a little different , because using the camera , the process was actually in planning .
and when you take a picture with a camera , the process ends when you press on the trigger .
so for me , photography seemed something more about being in the right place at the right time .
i thought everybody could do that .
so i wanted to create something else , something where the process begins when the trigger is printed .
photos like this : a construction site along a much traffic road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and still keeps a realistic level . and
or photographs like this - dark and colorful at the same time , but all with the common goal of keeping a realistic level . or .
when i say reality , i mean photo - reality .
because , of course , it ' s not something you can really capture , but i always want to it look like it could have had that in a photograph . because .
photographs where you have to think a brief moment to figure out the trick .
so it ' s more about capturing an idea than really taking a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it ' s about how we interpret the world , and how it can beible on a two - dimensional surface .
it ' s not about what ' s realistic , it ' s what we think is realistic .
so i think the fundamentalss are very simple .
i think of it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfectly ima physical objects here that we can all identify to with in a three - dimensional world .
but combined in a particular way , you can create something that still looks three - dimensional as if it could existed .
but at the same time , we know that ' s not possible .
so we ' re overlapcoming our brains , because our brains simply don ' t accept that it doesn ' t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combining photos .
it ' s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that make a picture look realistic , i think it ' s the things we don ' t think about , the things around us in our everyday lives . so .
but when we combine photographs , it ' s really important to think about it , because otherwise they just look kind of wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow to get a realistic result .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
but together , you can create something special like this .
so the first rule is that combined photographs should have the same perspective .
second , combined photographs should have the same lighting type lighting .
and these two pictures sati meet these two demands - fired at the same altitude and the same lighting type .
thirdly , it ' s about making it impossible to make separate where the individual images begin and end by connecting them seamlessly .
make it impossible to tell you how the photo was actually put together .
so byting color , contrast and lightness on the edges to the individual images , add photographic malicity , like field depth , desaverserated colors and disturce , we separate the boundaries between the different images and make them look like a single photograph , even though a image can basically contain hundreds of layers .
here ' s another example .
you might think that this is just a landscape , and the bottom part has been manipulated .
but this picture is actually completely assembled from photos of different places .
personally , i think it ' s easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don ' t have to compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that it took me several months to plan them to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish was been recorded on an fishing flight .
the shore is from another place .
the underwater part is from a quarry .
and yes , i even colored the house up the top of the island red to make it look swedish .
so to achieve a realistic result , from me , it ' s actually on planning .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
after that , it ' s about the combination of the different images .
and here , every piece is very well planned .
and then when you take good shots , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also pretty realistic . and
so there ' s all the tools are there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
thank you .
i ' d like to talk to you about why so many electronic health projects are falling missing .
and i think the most important point about this is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we introduced at radboud university was to hire a main listener .
it doesn ' t very scientifically - she puts a cup of coffee or tea and asks the patients , families , relatives , " how is it ?
how can we help you ? "
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems why everybody - maybe most of the electronic health projects fail : because we ve stopped listening .
this is my wireless scale . - a very simple thing .
it has a button , on / off .
and every morning i jump on it .
and yes , i have a task , as you may recognize .
i finished my job at 95 pounds .
it works very simple : every time i jump on the scalea , it sends my data to google health as well .
and they ' re also posted by my general doctor so he can see where my weight problem is , not just the moment i need cardiology support or something , but also with a look at the past . and . and
but there ' s something else .
you may know that , i have over 4 , 000 followers to twitter users .
so every morning i jump on my wireless scale , and people are already talking to me before i ' m in the car , " lunch just a little salad for today , lucy . " so
but that ' s the nicest thing that can happen , because this is the group pressure , group pressure to help patients , because that could be used for obesity , or it could get patients get the smoking . but
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and get them to play some kind of game together to better control their health .
next week , this comes out to the market .
there ' will be this little blood pressure that you plug to an iphone or something .
and it will enable people to measure their blood pressure at home , send it to their doctor and share it with others , for example , for something more than 100 dollars .
at this point , only the patients come in : not only can they take control , be the captain on their own ship , but they can also help us in health care in given of the challenges that face , and the cost explosion of health , double demand , and so on .
do techniques that are easy to use , and start with to hugcing patients in the team .
and you can do that through these techniques , but also through crowdsourcing .
and one of the things that we ' ve done is i want to share with you through a quick video .
we have all the guidance systems in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know very exactly where all the atms are around amsterdam .
we know another thing , where all the gas stations are .
and sure , we can find fast food chains .
but where would the next aed be to help this patient ?
we asked around , and nobody knew .
nobody knew where the next life - saving aed was found at that moment .
so , what did we do ? we did crowdsourcing in the netherlands .
we built up a website and we asked a crowd , " if you see an apollod , please share us where he is , when he left , " because sometimes he ' s closed during business hours , of course .
and over 10 , 000 aeds have been registered in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for this .
and we designed an ipad app .
we developed an app for layar , augmented reality , to find these aeds .
and if you ' re in a city like maastricht and someone collapses , you can use your iphone , and in the next few weeks your microsoft cell phone to find the next aed that can save lives . and
and since today , we want to introduce this not just as aed4u , as the product calls called itself , but also introduce as aed4us . and
and we want to take this to a global level .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universities , to help us behave like nodes to crowdsource these aeds around the world . and
and when you ' re on vacation and somebody collapse , whether it ' s your own family or somebody else , you can find an aed this .
the other thing we want to ask for about is that companies around the world are helping us confirm this future .
these could be clerk agents , or technicians , for example , just to make sure that the registered aed is still in its place .
please help us do that and try to improve health not just , but take it its hands .
thank you .
today i ' m going to tell you unexpected discoveries .
i work in solar technology industry .
and my little startup wants us to make ours become environmental by .
. it gives attention to crowdsourcing .
here ' s a short video of what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may take time to be loaded .
now - we can just skip that - i ' m going to skip the video instead .
no .
this is not .
okay .
solar technology is .
oh , my time ' s over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year break and work in an environment that is pretty much everything they actually hate , we had them work in government . so
the program is called code for america , and it ' s a little bit like the peace chip for computer geeks .
we choose some fellows every year , and we have them work with city councils .
instead of sending them to the third world , we send them to city hall halls .
and there they developed great apps , worked with urban employees .
but what they re really do is to show what ' s done with technology today . but .
so you meet al .
al is a fire hydrant in the city of boston .
here this it looks like he ' s looking for a date , but what he ' s really looking for is somebody swalloing him out when he ' s knee , because he knows he ' s not very good at burn fire when he ' s covered by a meter of snow . this . this .
how did he get look for help in this particular way ? how
we had a team of fellows in boston year on tour the code for america program .
they were there in february , and it did a lot of last february .
and they realized that the city never these fire hydrants .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik michaels - ober , noticed something else , and that was that the residents werely the sidewalks right in front of these parts .
so he did what every good developer would do , he wrote an app .
it ' s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you fail to free him when it ' s snow .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don ' t do that , somebody can take it away .
so there ' s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a modest little app .
it ' s probably the smallest of the 21 apps the fellows have written last year .
but it does something that no other government technology does .
it ' s rapidly spread rapidly .
there ' s this guy in the i . t . department in the city of hawaii who ' s seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but to make the citizens adopt tsunami sirens . there
it ' s very important that these tsunami sirens work , but people are stealing the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get citizens to clean up the clogged oils .
and chicago just introduced it so that people watch the buzzest when it s snow .
we now know nine cities are planning to use this app .
and it ' s spread smoothly , organic , of course .
if you know something about government technology , you know it doesn ' t usually work that way .
the software usually takes a few years .
we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year where took three people took two and a half months .
it was about a way where parents can figure out which are the right public schools are for their kids .
we were later told that if it went through the normal channels , it would have taken over two years , and it would have cost over two million dollars .
and that ' s nothing else yet .
there ' s a project right in the california justice that cost the taxpayers have cost two billion dollars , and it doesn ' t work .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so an app written in a few days , and then spreads itself , is a kind of a shot in front of the bug on the institution of government . so
it shows how the government could work better - no more like a private company , how many people think it should .
and not even like a technology company , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , that means open and productive .
and that ' s important . and .
but more important about this app is it represents a new generation tacpskling the problem of government - not as the problem of a locked institution , but as a problem of collective action . but
and this is a very good news , because it turns out that we ' re very good at collective action with digital technology .
now there ' s a large community of people who are making the tools that we need to effective effectively do things together .
it ' s not just code for america fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country standing up and writing government apps every day in their own communities .
they didn ' t give up government .
they ' re terribly frustrated with her , but they don ' t complain about it , they repair it .
and these people know something that we ' ve lost of our eyes .
and that ' s when you forget all your feelings about politics and the snake at the work office and all the other things that we really excite about is government , at heart , in the words of tim o ' neill , " what we do together that we can ' t do alone . "
today , a lot of people given up the government .
and if you ' re one of these people , i ask you to think about it because things are change .
politics doesn ' t change ; government is in change .
and because the government ultimately pulls its power out of us - remember , " we have the people ? " - how we think about it will affect how this change happens .
i didn ' t know very much about government when i started this program .
and like a lot of people , i thought that the government is all about getting people into office .
now after two years , i ' ve come to the conclusion that it ' s particularly in communities about thylaci cats .
this is the call center for service and information .
that ' s where you usually come out there when you call in your city 311 .
if you ever have the chance to work in your city call center , like our fellow scott silverman as part of the program - in fact , they all do - you ' ll see that people who call the government for a lot of different problems , including a thylaci is in their house .
so scott gets this gel .
he puts " thylacine " into the official database .
and he doesn ' t really have an idea . he starts with the animal predator .
and finally , he says , " look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock is falling off ? "
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that wasn was ' t the end of the thylaci rats .
boston doesn ' t just have a call center .
it has an app , a web and cell phone app , called citizens connect .
we didn ' t write this app . we
this is the work of very smart people at the office of new urban mechanics in boston .
one day - this is a real report - this came in : " thylacine in my garbage can . can ' t tell if she ' s dead .
how do i get it away ? "
but what happens to citizens connect is different .
scott was talking from man to - human .
but on citizens connect , everything is public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , a neighbor saw it .
and the next post we got was , " i went over there , found the garbage can behind the house .
thylaci ? yes . alive ? yap .
turned the trash can on the side . went home .
good night , sweet thylaci . "
pretty simple .
that ' s great . this ' s the digital hits the physical .
and it ' s also a good example of how the government is getting into crowdsourcing .
but it ' s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don ' t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform here .
i ' m more about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
one citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role here .
she connected these two people .
and you could have connected them to state services if they had been needed , but a neighbor is a much better and cheaper alternative to government services .
if one neighbor helps the other , we strengthen our communities .
let if let ' s call the animal hunter , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think is that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand this , but they think one is of the other ' input .
that our contribution to the system is voting .
how often have we chosen a political leader - and sometimes we ' ve used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader - and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and fulfill our needs , and then hasn that much has changed ?
that ' s because the government is like long ocean , and politics these ' are the top 15 centimeters .
and what ' s below it is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use that word with such contempt .
but it ' s this contempt that makes this thing that we own , and we pay for , be something that works against us , something else , and then we freeh ourselves . but
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that ' s where the actual government work is .
we have to engage the government machine .
so the occupythesec movement did .
did you see these guys ?
it ' s a group of concerned citizens who wrote a very detailed 325 - page report that ' s an answer to the sec memo on the financial reform . it
this is not politically active , this is be bureaucratic active .
now , for those of us who have given up government , it ' s time to think about it the world we want to leave our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to face .
do we really believe that we can achieve what we need to do without improving an institution that can act in the name of all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to get more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to fundamentally ref transform the function of government in a way that can actually do something by enpowerening society .
and there ' s a generation that grew up with the internet , and who knows that it ' s not that hard to do things together , all you have to is build systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i ' m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you . now .
this is a generation that has grown up to see their voice for granted .
they don ' t fight this fight that we ' re all fighting for who can talk ; they are all allowed to speak . they
you can make your opinion on every channel at any time , and you can do .
so when you ' re faced with the problem of government , you don ' t care so much about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the work government .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
this could be throw up a fire hydrant , washing weed , turning a trash can with a thylaci .
and sure , we could have wied these fire hydrants all the time , and a lot of people do .
but these apps are like little digital memoriesnder that we ' re not just consumers , and we ' re not just government consumers who pay taxes and receiving services . but .
we ' re more than that ; we are citizens .
and we ' re not going to improve government until we improve citizenship .
so the question that i have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all together , are we going to be a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands ? so ? so
thank you .
my role is to tell to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming out will be , and i thought , because since i ' m here among friends , i would tell you what i really think , and also try to look back and understand what ' s really going on here with these incredible jumps forward that are happen so quickly that we can ' tly compete . that happen that i ' that we .
i ' m going to start by showing you a single boring slide .
. could you just show the slide .
this is a slide that i happened to choose from my folder .
i ' m not about the details of the slide here , but i ' m actually about the general shape .
this slide shows data from an analysis by us on the performance of risc processors compared to the performance of a local area network . this
the ' interesting thing here is that this slide , like any other things that we often see in our field , are kind of straight just on a semi - logarithmic curve .
in other words , every step here corresponds to a power in the performance scale .
and this is a new thing that we need to use this type of scale on semi - logarithmic curves in the field of technology .
something very strange is happening here .
this is basically what i ' m going to talk about here .
so , if you could turn on the lights back on please .
a little brighter , because i ' m going to draw something on the paper here in a moment .
now , why do we draw graphs in technology on semi - logarithmic curves ?
the reason for that is , if i draw it on a normal curve where , say , these are the years , which is the timeline of a kind , and this is any mass of technology that i want to represent with a graph , the graph will silly .
they look like this .
and that doesn ' t tell us much . and
now , if i want to record another technology , let ' s say a transportation technology , it that would on the semi - logarithmic scale very dishcal in the form of a flat line . now
but when something like this happens , it changes the qualitative circumstances .
so if the transportation technology was progressing as fast as the microprocessor technology , we could get into a taxi , and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo . so
but it ' s t that fast .
this has never happened before in the history of technology development , this kind of recursive growth , which is increases increasing the scale increasing every few yearsnenti .
the question i want to ask you now is , if you look at these exponential curves , you see they don ' t go on forever .
it ' s not possible that everything will evolve forever and forever as fast as is .
there are two possibilities . there .
either it becomes a classic s - curve like this , until something completely new comes in , or it will happen here .
that ' s kind of .
now , i ' m an optimist , so i think something like the way this is going to happen .
if that really is the case , that means we ' re in the middle of a transition right now .
we ' re on this line , in a transition from the previous world to a new kind of world . we
so the question i want to ask , and i often ask myself , is how will this new world going be like ? so
what is this new state that the world is starting to adopt ?
because the transition seems be very , very confusing when you ' re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , the future was somewhere in 2000 , and people would often talk about what would was going to happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference here where people are talking about the future , and you realize that the future is still at year 2000 .
further we can ' t go beyond that .
so in other words , the future has by one year since i ' ve been in the world .
i think the reason for that is that we realize that something is happen going on .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we know that right now it doesn ' t make sense to try look at 30 or 50 into the future , because everything will be so different that a simple calculation of what we ' re doing now simply doesn ' t make any sense . and
so i want to talk about what that might be , this transition that we ' re in right now .
in order to do that , i ' m going to talk first about some of other things that really have nothing to do with technology or computers . to
because i think in order to really understand this , we need to step back and look at this on a longer time scale .
and that is what i want to look at this at on the time scale of earth ' s .
i think the whole picture makes sense if you divide it down into a few billion steps .
so let ' s go back , 2 . 5 billion years . the earth was a big , sterile rock tube with lots of chemicals on it . so
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good picture of how they did that .
i also think there are theories that start to understand how everything began with rna , but i ' m going to tell you a simplifiedstic story of about this , which is that at that time little droplets were fl floating around that had different kinds of recipes for chemicals .
some of these oil droplets had a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from outside and grow .
everybody who were like that started divisioning .
these little oil droplets were , in fact , the most primitive cell form . these
but these oil droplets were ' t alive in the today , because each one them was just a small random recipe of chemicals . but
and every time it divided , the chemicals that are that have spreaded to disqual quantities .
so each droplet was a little different .
in fact , the droplets , which had a more optimal composition for growth grew faster than others and incorporated more and more chemicals from the outside and divided faster . and .
so these they tendd to survive longer , and they spreaded to a greater scale .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but it more gets interesting when these droplets learned a trick about abstraction . so
in some way that we don ' t quite understand yet , these droplets have learned the ability to write information .
they ' ve learned to store thepe cell ' s protein as information in a certain chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , in this mindless , evolutionary way , they ' ve found a way allow them to write down what they were ins made of , so that information could be stored and copied . in
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information same over the time of 2 . 5 billion years that it came born has remained the same .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , is out of the exact same code and the same type .
and that every being uses exactly the exactly the same letters and the same code .
we ' re there that , just for fun , we can write things in this code .
and i have 100 microgramram here of a white powder that i ' m trying to keep in away from security guards .
there ' s - what i did is i took this code - the code is made up of normal letters that we use to symbolize - and i wrote my business card on a piece of dna , and i amp it 10 ^ 22 times . there
so if somebody wants a hundred million copies of my business card , i have enough for everyone in this room and even anyone in the world , and it ' s right here .
if i had actually been an selfishic , i would have written it on a virus and released it into the room .
so what ' s the next step ?
writing the dna was an interesting step .
and that ' s what led these cells - that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another very interesting step where things got completely different , which is that these cells started to communicate and exchange information , so that communities of cells .
i don ' t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually change their dna .
and that ' s why , for example , the persilience grows antibiotics grows .
some bacteria have figured out how to stay away from penicillin and written that information into with other bacteria into the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate with each other .
now this communication allowed the foundation of communities that were , in a sense , in the same boat ; they were synergetic .
so they either survived together , or they went together , which meant that if a community succeeded successful , all the individuals in the community were repeatedly and preferred by evolution .
the transition point is now where these communities put so close that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community into a sign chain on the dna .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years . and
at this point , we have multicellular communities , communities of many different types cells that act together as a single organism .
in fact , we ' re also such a multicellular community .
we have a lot of cells that are no longer assembled on their own .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities began to evo developlve so that the level in which evolution happened was no longer the single cell , but the whole cell community that we call organism . so
now the next step has happened within these communities .
the cell communities began to abstract information .
and they developed special structures that didn did nothing but process information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the information processing device that these cell communities have built .
they started training specialists within the community , specific structures that were responsible for learning , understanding and holding information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point , an individual - learning now happening within the period of an individual organism , rather than over that evolutionary period .
so one organism , could learn not to eat a particular fruit because it tasted bad and made it sick the last time he ate it .
now this could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas before that was hundreds of thousands of years were , because this information had to bearily be learned by the individuals who died because of this fruit , because these information processing structures were not already there .
so the nervous system has the evolutionary process using these special information structures , because evolution could now happen within an individual .
it could happen within a time learning frame .
what after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
for example , the most subtlet known version of this kind of communication is human language .
it ' s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , messy and confused idea in my head .
i ' m sitting here , basically givinging bluapping sounds from me hoping to create a similar confused idea in your head that has a little similar to my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , we turn it into sound , a sequence of sound , and we produce something very complicated in other people ' s minds . so
so this now allows us to work again as a single organism .
and what we ' ve actually done , we , humanity , is we ' ve started abstracting .
we go through the same stages that multicel organisms have gone through - the abstraction of our ways ofturing data , presenting processing .
for the , invention of language , example , was a small step in that direction .
telephone , computers , video bands , cd - roms and so on are all are our specialized mechanisms that we ' ve built in our community to handle this information .
and it connects all of us together to something that ' s much bigger , and is also able to evolve faster than we ' ve been before .
so today , evolution can happen in the time of microseconds .
you ' ve also seen ty ' s little example of evolution where he showed a little bit of evolution in the conclave program right in front of your eyes . you
so now we ' ve doubleade the time scales again .
the first steps of the story that i told you took a billion years a piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , took a few hundred million years .
then the next steps , like language and so forth , took less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , just seem to take a few decades .
the process feeds on itself , so becomes , i think , car - catalytic is the word for that - when something increasess its speed of change .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that ' s what we see here in this explosion of curve .
we see the process that feeds itself .
i live a professional living from building computers , and i know that i couldn ' t use the mechanism i use to build computers without the recent advances in computer technology .
my current work is to design objects with such high complexity that it ' s impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
i don ' t know what every single transistor does in the connect machine .
it has billions of them .
instead , what i do , and what the designers of thinking machines are doing , is we think at a certain abstract level , give it to the machine , and the machine makes it something that beyond our capabilities , better and faster than we could ever do themselves .
and she does it in part with methods that we don ' t even understand yet .
one method that ' s particularly interesting , and which i ' ve been using a lot a late recentlyly , is evolution itself .
so we ' re installing an evolutionary process in the machine that ' s going in the microsecond area .
to give you an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that emerges from random instructions .
we say , " computers , please generate a hundred million randomly selected sequences of instructions .
now , please perform all these randomly chosen instructions , do all the programs , and ultimately choose the ones who are closest to my judgment . "
so in other words , i define what i want first .
let ' s say i want to select numbers , which would be a simple example that i ' ve already used for .
so find programs that can select the most numbers .
of course , the chances of randomly instructions is very small that they just sort numbers by random , so probably none of the instructions will actually do that .
but one of them , if ' lucky might put two numbers in the right order .
now i say , " computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences that have closest to my plan .
store those , delete the rest .
now reproduce all the remaining ones that have best selected the numbers best .
and it ' s with a method of recombing , analog to reproduction . "
take two programs , and they produce kids by exchange their sub - programs , and the kids learn the characteristics of the sub - programs from the two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that have come from combinations of programs that have come a little closer to the requirements than others .
say , " please repeat this process . "
lua them again .
maybe it might include some mutations .
and try the again with another generation .
all of these generations take just a few milliseconds .
and so i can run through an evolution over millions of years evolution in the computer in a few minutes , or in more complicated cases a few hours .
finally , i get programs that can select numbers perfectly .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could have ever written by hand .
so when i look at these programs , i can ' t tell how they work .
i tried to understand them . i .
they ' re tricky and weird programs .
but they doing the job .
i know and i ' m sure they do the job , because they come from a series of hundreds of thousands of programs that have done the job .
because their life depended on whether they did the job right .
i once sat in a 747 with doug minsky , but he pull out a card and says , " oh look . look at this .
it says , " this plane is made of hundreds of thousands of tiny bits work together to make your flight safer . " isn ' t you make you more confident ? "
we know that a development process isn ' t optimal if it gets too complicated .
so we start to rely on computers for a process that ' s very different from classical engineering .
it allows us to produce things with much higher complexity than the normal methods would allow to produce .
and yet , we don ' t quite understand thebilities of this .
so in a way , technology overpowers us .
we ' re using these programs to make the computers much faster , so that we ' re able to do these processes even faster .
so there creates a feedback .
it gets faster and faster , and i think that ' s why it seems so confusing .
because all of these new technologies of today are feeding on themselves .
we lift up .
we ' ve re at a point that ' the analog is then when single - cell organisms evolved into multicellular organisms . we .
so we ' re the amoeba , and we can ' t quite tell what the hell we ' re actually creating here .
we ' re in the middle of this transition point . we
but i really think that something is coming after us .
i find it veryous for us to say that we are the end result of evolution .
and i think we all of us here are part of the creation of whatever comes next .
now , lunch is about before , and i think i ' m to stop here now before i ' m getting picked .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the star sky in the desert with the sufi singer mukhr ali .
we talked about that nothing has changed since the time of the ancient indian myth , " mahabharata . "
if we wanted to indians back then , we jump in a car and swimed across the sky . if
now we do it with airplanes .
at the time when the great indian warrior arjun was thi , he took a bow , he shot into the ground , and water came out .
now we do this with drillers and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
that made me really sad .
i was a little scared of technology . i
it scared me that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset without a camera and without tweet from my friends . it
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill it .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch .
this piece of 50 - year - old technology became the most magical thing for me .
it became a golden access to a world full of pirates and crashed ships and images in my imagination .
it felt me like our fancy watches and cameras were kept from dreaming .
they kept us from being inspired .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use it to enable magic rather than killing . and
when i was 16 , i started books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a storytelling device that can connect readers around the world .
it can know how to keep it .
it can know where we are .
it brings images and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
storytelling uses more and more senses .
but what do we do with this ? but
i ' m just going to go to khoya , which is an interactive ipad app . i
this says , " put your fingers on every light . "
and so - it says , " this box belongs . " that ' s i write my name .
and i becomes a figure in the book .
once in a while , a letter falls down to me - and the ipad knows gps where i live - it ' s rightly addressd to me .
the child in me is really exd by these possibilities . the
i talked a lot about magic . i
i don ' t mean about magicians and dragons , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass i always found quite exciting .
so you have to flip the ipad and drop out the fireflies .
and they looking at the way through the rest of the book . and
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can be in a single marble .
and so every book and every world here becomes a little mur that i bring here the magic device in the device .
and that opens up a map .
fantasy books have always had cards , but these maps were static .
this map grows and lightsows and serves an orientation in the rest of the book .
it also shows up in other parts of the book . it
i ' m going in here . i
it ' s also important for me to create something that ' s indian , but also very timed .
these are the apsaras .
we ' ve all heard about fairies and nymphs , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the apsaras ? we
the poor apsaras were trapped in indra ' s chambers for thousands of years in an old mummy book .
and we bring them back in a contemporary story for children .
it ' s a story that deals new issues , like the environmental crisis .
about the environmental crisis , a big problem in the last 10 years is that kids sit sitting in their rooms , at their computers , without going out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book , you ' re sent to a search . you have to go out and collect use the ipad camera ' s ipad camera to images of natural objects .
as a child , i had collections of sticks , rocks , pebbles and shells .
somehow kids don ' t do anymore .
this childhood episode is brought back . you have to go out to and take a picture of a flower and tag a chapter .
in another chapter , you have to photograph a of and tag it tree bark .
so you actually create a digital collection of photos that you can then put online .
a kid in london shows a picture of a fox and says , " oh , i saw a fox today . "
a kid in india says , " i saw a monkey today . "
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you actually captured .
there are a variety of ways of magic connecting the world and technology together . there .
in the next book , we ' re planning to an interaction where you use the video of the ipad , and through augmented reality see an animation of elfies appearing on a plant in front of the house . the .
at one point , the screen fills with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the wind , blow it away and read the rest of the book .
we ' re all moving towards a world where the natural forces of technology are closer and where magic and technology can approach . we
we use the sun ' energy . we
we bring our children and closer to the natural world and the magic , fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story . we
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in prisons or , prisons or deathmates .
i spend most of my time with the socially weakest in the social communities and places where there ' s a lot of hopelessness .
being here at ted , seeing and hearing how stimulating that is has given me a lot of power . being
in the short time here , i realized : ted has an identity .
you can say things here that have impact over global world .
and sometimes when something comes over ted , it gets a meaning and power that it wouldn ' t otherwise have otherwise .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we ' ve seen some fantastic presentations .
i think we ' ve learned that the words of a teacher ' have meaning , but the words of an engaged teacher are particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good things . but as a caring doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn ' t learn that in my work as a lawyer , by the way .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i was grew up in a family , a traditional african - american household dominated by a matriarch , and that matriarch was my grandmother .
she was a tough , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every family meeting .
it was also the beginning of a lot of conflicts in our family .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
her parents were born in virginia in 1840 as slaves .
she was born around 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped herview very much .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a little boy , she came up to me and hugged me .
she squed me so hard that i could barely breathe , and then she let me go .
a hour or two later , when i met her , she came up to me and said , " bryan , do you feel my hug ? "
and when i said , " no , " she hugged me again . when i said , " yes , " she left me alone .
she was something that made that you always wanted to be close to them .
the only problem with this was that she had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get her attention .
my cousins were walking all around the around .
i remember i must have been eight or nine that i woke up one morning and walked into the living room . all my cousins were walking around . i .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the room staring at me .
first of all , i thought that was a game .
i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very serious .
this went on 15 or 20 minutes . then she stood up and she came over to me . she took me by the hand and she said , " come on , bryan . you and i , we need to talk . "
i remember as if it was yesterday .
i ' ll never forget it .
she took me outside and said , " bryan , i ' m going to tell you something , but you have to promise you don ' t to pass it on . "
i said , " promise grandma . "
she said , " honor word ? " i said , " yes . "
she sat down and she looked at me . she said , " i want you to know that i ' ve watched you . "
she said , " i think you ' re something special . "
she said , " i think you can do anything you want to do . "
i ' ll never forget that .
then she said , " you just have to promise me three things , bryan . "
i said , " ok , grandma . "
she said , " first of all , promise me you will always love your mommy . "
she said , " your mom is my baby , and you have to promise with promise that you will always take care of her . "
i ado loved my mother , so i said , " yeah , mom , i ' ll going to do that . "
then she said , " next thing , i promise me you will always do the right thing , " even if it ' s hard to do the right thing . "
i thought it and i said , " yeah , grandmy . i promise . "
finally , she said , " the last thing you have to promise me is , " you ' re never going to drink alcohol . "
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , " yes , grandmy . i promise it . "
i grew up in the country , in the old rural south , and i have a brother who ' s a year older old and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this six - packk beerbed my sister and i and went to the forest with us . when
we ' re just going around there as we can . we
then he took a drink of beer , and he offered my sister one , and she accepted , and then they offered me one .
i said , " no , no , no . all right . just do it . i don ' t want beer . " i "
my brother said , " well , do ahead . we ' re going doing this today , you ' do everything we do .
i had something , your sister had something . go on , have a beer . "
i said , " i don ' t want to . just do it . just do it . "
my brother was staring at me .
he said , " , what ' s going on about you ? well , drink something . "
then he looked at in my face , and he said , " oh no , you don ' t still always get crazy because of the conversation with grandma ? "
i said , " what are you talking about ? "
he said , " grandma tells all the grandchildren they ' re special . "
i was devastated .
i ' m going to admit something . i
i probably shouldn ' t do that . i
this may be publicly .
i ' m 52 years old , and i admit that i ' ve never drunk a drop of alcohol . i
i ' m not saying that because i think it ' s virtuous . i ' m say that because identity means power .
if we can create the right kind of identity , we can tell the people around us things that they don ' t believe at first . if .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn ' t .
of course , my grandmother would tell all her grandchildren re special .
my grandfather was in jail during the mccarthyhibition .
my uncles died of alcohol induced diseases .
and she believed that these were the topics that we needed to care about .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
this country is different from 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300 , 000 people were in prison and in prison .
today it is 2 . 3 million .
the united states today has the world ' s highest incarceration rate today .
seven million people are sentencedd to rehabilitation or with conditional criminal suspension .
in my view , mass inments fundamentally changed our world .
in social weak and black parts of the population , there are despair and hopelessness because of these changes . in
one out of three male black between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , released for rehabilitation or with conditional suspension .
in urban communities all across the country - from los angeles to philadelphia , to baltimore to washington - 50 to 60 percent of all black young men are either in prison , in prison , released in rehabilitation or conditional . in
but our system is not only shaped by questions that have to do with race , but it ' s also defsed by poverty . but
we have a legal system in this country that treat them much better if they ' re rich and guilty than poor and innocent .
wealth , not debt , influencess the outcome .
yet we seem to be very happy with it .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we lost contact . we
i think that ' s interesting .
there are some very interesting developments .
my home state of alabama is permanently gives them the right to vote when they ' re prose convicted . my .
here today in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population have permanently lost their right to .
we predict that in 10 years , the rate of recognition of civil honor will be as high as before the voting to bill passed .
the silence is earening .
i represent children .
a lot of my clients are very young .
the united states is the only country in the world that condes 13 - year - old children to death in jail .
in this our country , there are lifelong sentences for children without condition suspension .
we ' ve already run a lot of techniques . we
the only country in the world .
i represent people in death cells .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we believe that because we ' ve been taught way that the real question is : does a man deserve to die for a crime committed ?
that ' s a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about it depending on how we see our identity .
the other view is not : did anyone deserve death for a crime , but , do we deserve to kill ?
i think that ' s fascinating .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
on nine people we executed , one that we ' ve found innocent , who was rescued and released out of the death row .
an amazing error rate . one of nine innocent .
i think that ' s fascinating .
we would never let anybody fly on an airplane if for nine planes that fly , one crash .
but somehow we able to remote ourselves from this problem .
it ' s not our problem .
it ' s not our burden .
it ' s not our fight .
i talk a lot about these questions .
i ' m talking about race and of whether we have the right to kill .
and it ' s exciting because i teach my students african - american history . i ' m talking about slavery .
i ' m talking about terrorism , the time before the end of reconstruction , all the way to the beginning of world war .
we don ' t really know a much about it .
but for the african - american people in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of terrorist .
or before bombs . or .
it was the fear of terror that shaped their lives .
now these older people come to me and say , " mr . stevenson , they ' re , they ' re giving talks , they tell people to stop saying for we deal with terrorism for the first time our nation , after 9 / 11 . "
they say , " no - tell people that we grew up with this . "
and after terrorism , of course , race seg and decades of racially - motivated immigration and apartheid .
and yet , in our country , there ' s a dynamic - we don ' t like to talk about our problems .
we don ' t like to talk about our story . we
and so we don ' t really understand what meaning our actions have in the historical context . and
we ' re always colling .
we always create new tensions and new conflict .
it ' s hard for us to talk about race , and i think that ' s because we ' re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation . it
in south africa , people have understood that race is not overcome without the willingness of truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there was this willingness , but not in this country .
i given some talks in germany about death penalty .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , " you know , it ' s deeplyoun disturbing to hear you talk that way . "
he said , " there is no death penalty in germany .
and of course , in they can never be there . "
it became all silenced . then a woman said , " our story , it ' s impossible our that we ever stand again for systematic killing of people . it .
it would be unless of us to be consciously and targeted people . "
i thought about it .
how it would feel like to live in a world where the german state was had people , especially if there were unacceginable number of jews .
it would be uncomfortable .
it would be humanless . it
and yet , here in this country , in the old southern states , we are re looking people - here ' s the risk of being sentenced to death , 11 times higher if the victim is white than if it ' s black , 22 times higher if the accused is black and the victim is white - in the same states in which the bodies of miserable people rest . and
and yet , there ' s this mental disconnect .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don ' t deal with these difficult issues , the positive and wonderful things are affected as well .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but ultimately , these realities are overesti by suffering , abuse , depress , discrimination .
it seems to me to me to unite both two . it
because we end up talking about how we need more hope , more commitment , more dedication , to liveist in a complex world . because
for me , that means time to think and talk about the poor , the disadvantaged , the ones who will never be at ted .
but think in a way that is embedded in our own lives .
we all need to end up believe believing in things that we can ' t see .
we do that . as rational as we are , as much we value intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development isn ' t just come from our heads .
they come from ideas driven by belief in our hearts .
it ' s this head - heart connection that i think drives us to be not just be open to all the bright and exciteciting things , but also the dark and problematic things .
vaclav , the great czech politician , once said .
" when we fought eastern against the oppression in europe , we wanted all kinds of things , but what we needed most was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places and to be witness . "
this mental orientation is the core of what i believe the ted communities need to engage in too .
there ' is no distinction between technology and design that allows us to be completely human , as long as we don ' t have eyes and ears for poverty , discrimination and injustice . there
i want to war you . this kind of identity attracts a lot more of us than if we didn ' t care about it .
she will to profoundly touch them .
as a young lawyer , i have the great privilege to meet rosa parks .
mrs . parks kept coming back to montgomery , where she met two of her oldest friends , these older women , johnnie carr , who had organized the montgomery bus band - an incredible african - american woman - and virginia durr , a white woman whose husband , clifford durr , represented dr . king . she
so these women met and they just talked .
sometimes occasionally ms . carr called me and said , " bryan , ms . parks is coming to the city . we want to talk to . and
do you want to come and listen ? "
and i said , " yes , very much . "
she said , " and what are you going to do if you ' re here ? "
i said , " i ' m going to listen . "
and i went over and just listened . and
it was always so inspiring , so inspowering .
one day , i was sitting there listening to these women , and after a few hours , mrs parks turned to me around us , " well , barry , tell me what the equal right initiative is .
what are you trying to do ? "
i started with my usual talk .
i said , " we ' re trying to fight injustice .
wr wants to help people who are innocent convicted .
we want to fight biasy and discrimination in the criminal justice system .
we want to eliminate lifelong sentences without condition sentences for children .
we want to do something about death penalty .
we want to reduce the number of prisoners .
we want to eliminate mass arrestration . "
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , " oom . oom . hum . "
she said , " this ' s going to make you very , very tired . "
then ms carr leaned to me , put a finger on my face , and said , " that ' s you have to be very , very brave . "
and so i believe that the ted community should be more braver .
we have to find ways to face these challenges : these problems , this suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our all humanity .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i learned a few very simple things .
that we ' re all more than the worst thing we ' ve ever done .
i think that ' s true of every human on the planet .
when someone is lying , it they ' s not just a liar .
if somebody takes something they don ' t belong to , they ' s not just a thief .
even who kills someone is not just a murderer .
and because that ' s the case , there ' s a fundamental human dignity that the law must respect .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the world , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don ' t think so .
i believe that in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i believe that even though it ' s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so inspiring , we end ' re not being measured by our technology , not by the things we develop , not by our intellect and minds . and
finally , a society is not measured by how it treat its rich and powerful and privileged , but by how it deals with the poor , the convicted , the prisoners .
because in this context , we begin to understand the truly amazing things that make us .
sometimes i lose balance . a story at end .
sometimes i push too much .
i get tired , like all of us .
sometimes these ideas predipive our thinking in a very important way .
i represent these kids who were sentenced to very hard punishments .
i go to the isolation center and i visit a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , who ' s supposed to in court as an adult . i .
then i wonder , how could that happen ?
how can a judge turn someone into something they ' re not ?
the judge looks sees him as an adult , but i see a child .
one night , i stayed too long and thinking , my godness , if a judge can turn us into something else , he must have magic .
right , bryan , the judge has magic powers .
you should also want wish one .
and because it was late , and i couldn ' t think right anymore , i started working on an proposal .
i had a 14 - year - old poor black boy as clients . i
and i started with this request , and the headline was , " request to treat my poor , 14 - year - old black clients as a privileged white , 75 - year - old top manager . " and "
in my proposal , i declared that mistakeducts of prose and police and court mistakes .
there was a crazy line about the fact that there ' s nothing more right in this country , that there ' s miscontchs .
the next morning , i woke up and i didn ' t know if i just dreamed this crazy proposition or actually wrote it .
and to my dismay , i only had not only write him , but i had have sent him the court .
a few months went by , and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to the court and this crazy case .
i got in the car and i was really overwhelmed - overwhelmed . i
so i went to the court . so
and i thought , this is going to be so hard , so painful .
finally , i got out of my car and walked up the stairs to the court .
when i walked up the stairs to the court , there was an older black man , the janitor in the court .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , " who are you ? "
i said , " i ' m a lawyer . " he said , " you ' re a lawyer ? " i said , " yes . "
he came up to me and hugged me . he
then he whispered into my ear .
he said , " i ' m so proud of you . "
and i have to say , it gave me power .
it touched something deep inside me , identity , the ability of each individual to contribute to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i walked into the courtroom .
as soon as the judge saw me .
he said , " mr . stevenson , did you asked this crazy proposition ? "
i said , " yes . " and then we started talking .
more and more people coming in just because they were angry .
that i had written these crazy things .
police officers came in and senior prosecutors and office officers .
in hands , the courtroom was full of people who were angry that we were talk talking about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
from my eye , i saw the janitors go going up and down .
he kept looking through the window , and could hear the whole tohuwabohu .
he went up and down . he
finally , this young black man with a very concernedful look came into the courtroom and sat right behind me , almost on the defense front .
ten minutes later , the judge paused .
during the break , a police officer came in and who disturbed that the janitor was in the courtroom .
this deputy ran over to the older black . this
he said , " jimmy , what do you do in the courtroom ? "
the older black man stood up . he looked at the deputy , then he looked at me , and he said , " i came here to tell this young man , don ' t lose the goal from your eyes . don ' t give up . "
i came to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral penmutlum of the universe is evo faring way , but that it affects justice .
that we are not fully evolved as humans as long as we don ' t care about human rights and basic values .
that our all survival is linked to each individual ' s survival .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity with humanity , compassy and justice .
and most of all , i want to say all those of you who see this as well , don ' t lose the goal out of your eyes . don ' t give up .
you ' ve seen and heard this audience , in this community to help them and do something . you
what else can we do ? .
bryan stevenson : well , there are possi everywhere .
if you live in california , there ' s a people ' decision spring about actually doing an effort to shift some of the amount of money that else would go into the politics of punishment . if
here , example in california , in the next five years you will ll spend a billion dollars on death penalty . a billion dollars .
and yet 46 percent of all death reports don ' t end up with a arrest .
56 percent of all rape cases do not come to court .
here ' s the opportunity to do something .
this reference will suggest to invest the money into more security forces and security .
i think there are possi everywhere .
over the last three decades , crime rate has declined dramaticarmously declined in america .
this fact is often put in relation to increased incarceration rates .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
well , in fact , the number of homiroci crimess has not changed very much .
most of the mass inrceration in this country didn ' t really happen in the class of violence crimes .
it was the misguided crossover against drugs .
that ' s why the dramatic high numbers come in prison .
we ' ve got drawn by the rhetoric of punishment .
now we have " three violations laws that keep people behind bars , for a bicycle stealing , for theft of low good , rather than forcing them to give back things back to the victims .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of a crime , not less .
and i think that our current punishment philosophy today doesn ' t help anybody .
i think that ' s what we need to change .
bryan , they actually made a string to vibrate here .
they ' re an inspiring personality .
thank you for being at ted . thank you .
bin laden ' s death has an increased risk of danger .

8 : tsunami warning . 9 : cyber attacks .

crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god . oh
so these are just a few of the clips that i ' ve collected over the last six months - but it could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
in fact , the media preferfers to show us negative topics , because our minds only attention those topics .
and there ' s a very good reason for that as too .
every second every day , our senses capture up lot more information than our brain can ever process .
and because we nothing more important than our survival , the first stop for all this information is a part of our temporal lobe , the amygdala . and
so the amygdala is our early warning system , our danger manager .
it organizes and looks through all the information looking for any indication of danger in our environment .
so when we see the news , we prefer looking for negative news .
and the old adage , " when it s ble , demand rising " is very true .
now , with all our digital devices that are giving us seven days a week , 24 hours a day all these negative news day , it ' s no wonder that we are re pessimistic .
it ' s not a wonder that everybody thinks the world is getting worse getting worse .
but maybe that ' s not the case .
maybe that ' s the reality .
maybe the trermous progress that we ' ve made in the last century through a number of forces has acceler so strong that in the next three decades we ' re be able to create a world of abundance .
well , i ' m not saying that we don ' t have big problems - climate crisis , biodiversity loss , water and energy problems - we already have them .
and as humans , we ' re much better at predipating problems in the very long run , but ultimately overcome them .
let ' s look at what we ' ve achieved in the last century so we can predict evolution .
in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled , the adapted average income of the world ' population has tripled .
child mortality has reduced by a tenth .
and the other thing is that diet , electricity transportation and communication costs have reduced by a lotfold .
steve pinker has shown us that we living in a very peaceful time of human history .
and according to charles kenny , literacy rate has gone from 25 percent to 80 percent in the last 130 years .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and a lot of people forget this .
and we ' re keep constantly increasing our expectations .
in fact , we redefined poverty . in
remember that a large percentage of americans who live below the poverty line have access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , televisions , cell phones , air conditioners and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the ' imperators , could never have dreamed of such luxury goods .
the basis of a lot of this is technologies , and they are growing exponentially .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that becomes information technology makes big huge moore ' s law leaps on the , and the price - performance quotient double doubless every 12 to 24 months .
that ' s so the cell phone in your pocket costs about a million times less and is s a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the ' 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore ' s law of the last hundred years .
notice two things about this curve .
the first is how smooth it goes - in good times and bad times , war or peace , recession , depression and high depression .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
it ' s not slows down for any of our big problems .
and , despite its logarithmic line on the left , it goes upward .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore ' s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to everyone .
cloud computing , something my friends at call " infinite computingdes , " sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers that enable you to democratize personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , fuels , vaccines and food , digital medicine , nano materials and artificial intelligence . my call
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm ' s supercomputer watson at " risk ?
that was fantastic .
i went looked through the newspapers and looked for the best headlines i could find .
i love this one : " watson defeat human enemies . "
" risk " is not a simple game .
it ' s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence was available to every owner of a cell phone .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i started a new university at ted called singularity university .
we teach our students all of these technologies , special focused on how they can be used to solve humanity ' s big challenges .
and every year we ask students to create companies , products and services that within a decade can positively affect the lives of billion of people .
think about how a group of students can affect the lives of billions of people today .
30 years ago , this had been ridiculousls .
today we can refer to dozens of companies that have done that .
when i think about creating abundance , i don ' t mean a life of luxury for everyone on the planet ; it ' m about creating a life of possibilities .
it ' s about building savingndance from scarce goods .
because scarcity is contextual , and technology is a resource - liberating force .
here ' s an example .
this is the story of napoleon iii , in the middle - 18th century .
he ' s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of siam for dinner .
napoleon ' s soldiers got silver bribes , napoleon himself got gold bribes .
but the king of siam got aluminum bres . but
aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet time , more valuable than gold and platinum .
this ' is s why the dome of the washington monument was made aluminum .
although aluminum takes 8 . 3 percent of the earth ' s mass , it doesn ' t look like pure metal . although
it ' s connected by oxygen and silicon .
but then the electrostaty was developed and made aluminum production so cheap that we use it with our throwaway mentality .
then let ' s project this analogy into the future .
we think about energy scarcity today .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that ' filled with 5 , 000 times more energy than we use every year .
16 terawatts of energy is are bou pourilling to the earth of s surface every 88 minutes .
it ' s not scarcity ; the problem is access .
and there ' s good news .
this year , they ' ve been able to reduce the cost of solar electricity in india to 50 percent of the diesel electricity - 8 . 8 rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year .
last month , this published a study that shows that by the end of this decade in the sunny areas of the united states , solar will cost six cents a gallowh compared to 15 cents on the national average .
and if we have an amount of energy , we will have water in abundance .
let ' s talk about water wars .
do you remember when carl sagan passed the voyager spacecraft in 1990 , when it passed by saturn , back towards earth ?
he took a famous picture . what did it mean ?
" a pale blue dot . "
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet that ' s 70 percent covered in water .
yes , there ' s 97 . 5 percent saltwater , two percent is frozen , and we ' re fighting for 0 . 5 percent of the water on the planet , but there ' s also hope here .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
there ' s new nanotechnology on the way , nanotub materials .
and from a talk this morning with dean kaman , one of the innovators of do it yourself , i want to share something with you - he gave me the permission - his technology called " slingshot , " and which many of you may have heard of . it ' s the size of a refrigerator in the college . and . and .
it can create a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day from different sources - whether ' saltwater , contaminatuted water , latrine - and all of that for less than two cents an . it
the head of coca - cola has just agreed to start a big test project with a hundreds of units in the developing world .
and if everything goes well , and i ' m very confident , coca - cola will apply this technology globally in 190 countries around the planet .
this is technology - driven innovation that we ' s have today . this
and we ' ve also seen this on mobile phones .
oh my goodness , we ' re about to reach the 70 percent coverage rate of mobile phones in the developing world by the end of 2013 .
just remember a masai warrior with a mobile phone in the middle of kenya has a better mobile communication than president reagan did 25 years ago .
and if you ' re looking for google with your phone , you have more access to knowledge and information than president clinton 15 years ago . and
they live in a world that has information and communication abundance as no one has ever predicted .
and it ' s even better , the things that you and i have spent spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on - gps , hd video and photo , libraries full of books and music , technology medical diagnosis - are now literally decoplozed and cheaper in your cell phone . and
and the best part may is be what we re expecting in health .
last month , i had the pleasure of annocinging the samsung foundation the so called the " $ 10 million samsung tricorl x prize . "
we ' we asking teams around the world to connect all of these technologies in a cell phone so that you can talk to the device because it ' s equipped with ai , you can jump in or test your blood levels . we
and to win , the device has to make a better diagnosis than a team of highly qualified doctors .
imagine this device in the middle of a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease burden and 1 . 3 percent of the health care employees .
if this device sequences a rna or dna virus that ' s not known , it calls the health care agency and prevents a pandemic from it outbreak .
but now to the greatest force that will lead us to a world of abundance .
i call it " the next billion . "
the white lines represent population .
we ' ve just crossed the seven billion brand .
and just by the way , the biggest protection against population explosion is a better education and nutrition in the world .
in 2010 , we had just connected together under two billion people online .
by 2020 , we ' re probably going to go from two to five billion internet users .
three billion new minds that we ' ve never heard of before will join global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are they going consume ? what will they to want ?
and instead of economic stagnation , i see one of the greatest economic push in history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that will flow into the global economy .
and they ' re going get healthier by using the tricoder , and they ' ll get better educated trained by through the khan academy , and by going to have the ability to use 3d printers and infinite computing and be so much more productive than ever before . and . and
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the community bring us ?
how about a set of new voices never heard before ?
how about giving the oppressed , wherever they are , a voice to alert and create change for the first time ?
what are these three billion people bring in ?
how about contributions that we can ' t even predict ?
one of the things that i ' ve learned from the x prize is that small teams inspired by passion and focus can create extraordinary things , things that big companies and governments could only create in the past .
i want to end with a story that really excited me .
there ' s a program that some you may know .
it ' s a game called foldit .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it ' s a game in which people can take a sequence of amino acids to study how the protein will going to evolve .
depending on its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in medical research .
so far , this has was a problem for supercomputers .
and this game was played by university professors and so on .
and there are now hundreds of thousands of people who have played the game online .
and it showed that today human pattern recognition better folds the proteins than the best supercomputers .
and when these people came and looked at who ' s the best protein programmer in the world , this was t a mit professor , it wasn ' t a caltech student , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who worked as a in a rehab clinic during the day and was the best protein programmerer in the world at night .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me tremendous trust in our future is the fact that today we have more power than individuals tofront the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a diy innovator .
we have the capital of techno - philanthropists .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work with online to deal with the new challenges and to do what it takes .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we have to do something against a changing piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a doctor , and that ' s me .
and maybe i ' ve been in business for long that i can allow myself to give up a piece of my own false prestige to make it that happen possible .
but before i get to the actual theme of my talk , let ' s start with a little bit of baseball .
hey , why not ?
we ' re close to the season , and we ' moving to the world championship cup . we
we all love baseball , right ? we
baseball is full with of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
" moneyball " soon comes and it ' s about statistics and to use them to create a great baseball team .
i ' m going to refer to a statistic that i hope most of you have heard of before .
it ' s the average performance of the bat .
we ' re talking about a 300 when a bat beats 300 .
that means the player surely beats three out of 10 beats . that
that is hitting the ball in the outside field , it comes up , it ' s not caught , and who tried the ball to throw to the first base , didn ' t make it in time , and the runner was safe .
three from 10 . three
do you know what to call a 300 in major league baseball ?
well , really good , maybe an all - star .
do you know what to call a 400 ?
this is somebody who ' s actually sure probably meets four out of 10 . this
legendary - like ted williams legendary - the last major league baseball player who hit over 400 times during a regular season .
let ' s move back to my world of medicine , where i feel much more comfortable , or maybe a little less comfortable after i talked to you about it .
suppose you have a blind disease , and you ' re sent to an surgeon whose average performance is 400 in terms of blind disorders .
somehow it doesn ' t work , right ?
suppose you live in a particular remote area , and you have a belo one person with clogged heart valve , and your home doctor passes him to a cardiologist whose average performance at vascular is 200 .
but , but you know what ?
it ' s much better this year . it ' s on the rising floor .
and she beat a 257 .
somehow it doesn ' t work .
but i ' m going to ask you a question .
what do you think the average performance for a cardiologist or a nurse or an orthopedic or a birthtriciect , a rescue assistant ? what
1 , 000 , very good .
the truth is nobody in all of medicine knows what a good surgeon or doctor or a rescue officer should be .
however , what we do is we send each of you , including me , into the world with the claim of perfect .
never make a mistake , but nobody thinks about the details of how this to be done .
and that ' s the message that i recorded in medical school .
i was a compsive obsessional student .
in high school , a classmate once said that brian goldman was going to learn for a blood test .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little rooftop in the sisters nurse ' s facility at toronto general hospital , just from here .
i memorized everything .
in my anatomy lecture , i learned the origins and implications of each muscle , every branch of every artery that passes away from the aorta , obscure and ordinary differential diagnostics . in
i even knew the differential diagnosis for classifying renal tubulary azklesis .
and all the time i collected more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i graduated from college .
and i left medical school with the impression that , if i memorized everything and knew everything , or at least as much as possible , as close complete as possible that i was immune to making mistakes . and .
and it worked for a while , until i met mrs printers .
i lived at a teaching hospital here in toronto when woman printer was brought to the emergency department of the hospital . i .
at that point , i was assigned to the cardiology layer in cardiology service .
and it was my assignment when the emergency person was looking for cardiology advice to study the emergency patient .
and give feedback to my graduate doctor .
i studied woman printers , and she was in breathot .
and when i listened to her , she made noiling noise . and
and when i stopped her chest with the stethoscope , i could hear a cracking sound on both sides , which told me that she was suffered from recurop heart failure .
this is a state where the heart fails , instead of pumping the blood , part of the blood in the lung and fills it slowly , so which is why the short beatmoss came .
and that was not a hard to treat .
i put her down and went to treatment .
i gave her amino anti acidy . i gave her medicine to take the pressure off the heart .
i gave her medicine what we call diuretics , water pills so that she would peel off the liquid .
and over a an year and a half to two , she began to feel better .
i felt really good .
and then i made my first mistake ; i sent it home .
actually , i made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my head doctor .
i didn ' t take the phone and do what i should have had , what a phone call would have from my graduate doctor to explain him to him , so that he had a chance to make a own picture .
and he knew her that he had been able to bring more information to her .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn ' t want to be the need doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i was acting like that this , and so i would be able to care of my patients without having to contact him . maybe
my second mistake was worse .
so sending them home , i ignzed a quiet voice in me trying to tell me , " goldman , no good idea . don ' t do that . "
in fact , i was so much lacked self - security that i asked the nurse who took care of woman ' printer , " do you think it ' s okay to you go home ? "
and the nurse thought about it and said , in fact way , " yeah , i think she ' s going to be finey . "
i remember as if it was yesterday .
so i signed the ex papers , and a ambulance and the ambulance workers came and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , the night , i had this gring feeling in my stomach .
but i kept working . but
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , left the hospital and went to the parking lot to drive home the , when i did something i didn ' t do otherwise .
i went home through the emergency room on my way .
and there was another nurse said , not the sister who had seen printer after her woman , but another three words to me , and those three words feare most emergency doctors i know . and . and
other doctors also fear these too , but emergency medicine is quite special because we just see the patients so fleetling .
the three words are : remember this ?
" do you remember the patient you sent home ? "
asked the nurse correctly .
" so , she ' s back , " she said in this particular tone .
so she was back . so
she was back and dying .
about an hour after she got home after i sent her home , she collapsed , and the family called 971 , and the rescue agents took her back to the emergency facility with a blood pressure of 50 blood , which is a dangerous state of shock .
she barely breathed and had turned blue .
the emergency staff pulled all the strands .
they gave her blood printer .
they attached them to the anesthetic machine .
i was shocked and i crushed to inside .
and i lived through this rollercoaster because to intensive care unit after stabilized , and i hoped that she would recover . and
and after two , three days , it became realized that she was never going to wake up again . and .
she had suffered a non - treatable brain damage .
her family gathered together .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they followed what was happening . and
the next day they had them go - mr printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
they ' re said you never forget the names of those who die dying .
and this was the first time i learned this myself .
for the next few weeks , i madeuing , and i learned for the first time learned the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture - i felt alone , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame you feel , because you can ' t talk to the colleagues .
you all know the healthy shame when you give a secret from the best friend , even though he swows you into conflictity and then you ' re get caught and the best friendfronts you with and has my a terrible discussion , but when you end up lead the bad feeling leads you , and you admit you never make such a mistake again . you ,
if you do re and you never make the mistake again .
this is the kind of educational shame .
the unhealthy way i ' m talking about is the one that makes you sick inside .
it ' s the one who tells you that ' s not what you ' ve done bad , but that you ' re bad yourself .
and that ' s what i felt .
and it wasn ' t because of my graduate doctor ; he was very kind .
he was talking to the family , and i ' m sure he smoothed the laugh and made sure i wasn ' t get sued .
but i kept on to asking myself these questions .
why didn ' t i ask the doctor ? why did i send her home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
why did i go to medicine ?
slowly but safely it set .
i started to feeling better .
and then on a cloudy day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke out , and i said , maybe i can feel better again .
and i pointed to myself that if i doubled my effort on perfection and never made a mistake again , the voice could mutze .
and she did .
and i kept to working .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had serving in the emergency room in a local hospital north of toronto , and i looked at a 25 - year - old man with irrational revenge .
there was a lot of work on and i was in a hurry . it
he always pointed out here .
i looked in the fang , and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and i sent him off .
and even when he walked out of the door , he pointed to his revenge . and
two days later , i came to my next emergency service , and my chief doctor asked me to a conversation in her office . and .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
" do you remember the patient with the irrational revenge ? "
it turns out he ' s a streptococol infection .
he had a potentially life dangerous disease called epiglottitis .
you can google that , but it ' s not a infection of revenge , it ' s of the upper breathory and causes the box of the breathory channels .
and fortunately , he didn ' t die .
he got intravenl antibotica and recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same taste of shame and self - doubt , felt liberated , and went back to work until it happened again and again .
in an emergency layer , i reported a blind syndrome times .
there ' s a lot of it this , especially when you think you ' working in a hospital that only had 14 patients a night at that time .
in both cases , i didn ' t send them home , and there was probably no shortage in their treatment either . in
one of them people thought he had kidney stones .
i arranged the x - ray of the kidneys , and when it was without finding , my colleague the re - the a defation in the lower right and called the surgeon . and
the other one had a severe diarrhea . the
i cookeled fluid to rehydrate it , and i asked my colleagues to see it as well .
and that ' s what he did , and when he found a displetion in the right lower sector , he called the surgeons .
in both cases , surgery was and they were doing well .
both cases scratching me , asked me up . both
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years , which many of my colleagues say , but is totally nonsense .
some of my mistakes have happened over the last five years .
alone , embaramed and without support .
here ' s the problem : if i can ' t end with my mistakes and talk about them , if i can have the quiet voice that tells me what really happened , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes so that they don ' t do the same things ?
if i went to into a room - like right now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when ' s the last time you heard about someone who talk talking about failure about failure about failure ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party , and you may hear about some other doctor , but you ' re not going to hear somebody talking about your own mistakes .
if i went to a room full of colleagues and ask for their immediate support and started telling them what i just told you , i probably wouldn ' t reach the end of the second story before they really uncomfortrasd , somebody would sub a joke , they would change the topic and forget the rest . if and ask for their i would change their
and in fact , if i or my colleagues knew that an orthopedid in my hospital had taken ' s wrong leg , believe me , i had problems looking him in the eyes . and
this is the system that we live in .
it ' s a complete denial of errors .
it ' s a system in which there are two basic positions - those who make mistakes and those who don ' t make things - those who constraify sleep deprivation and those without constraint , those with bad results and those with good results .
it ' s almost an ideological reaction , like antibodies that attack a human .
and there ' s the idea that if we remove those who make mistakes from medicine , we a safe system . and
but there are two problems with this .
in my about 20 years of medical television and journalism , i did a personal medical study of medical errorss and wrong treatments to learn for one of my first articles i wrote for the toronto star to my show , " white coat , black art . " . " in of in
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely inevitable .
we work in a system where mistakes happen every day , where one out of 10 drugs is either a wrong or a wrong , where hospital infections become more and more and cause devastation or dead . we .
in this state , about 24 , 000 canadians die of transaction errors .
in the united states , the institute of medicine estimates the number at 100 , 000 .
both of these are strong understatements , because we don ' t look at the problem as much as we should .
and it ' s the crux .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge double doubles every two to three years , we can ' t keep up .
sleep deprivation is ubiquitous .
we can ' t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive error , so that we can take a perfect disease path for a patient with chest pain .
then i take the same patient with chest pain , make him sweaty and i swhy and i give a slightly alcoholized breath , and all of a sudden the story is mixeded with contempt .
i ' m not going to take the same line .
i ' m not a robot ; i don ' t always do things the same way . i
and my patients are not cars ; they don ' t always tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all of this put in together , mistakes inevitable .
so if you take the system the way i ' ve been taught , and you eliminate out all the mis health experts , nobody is left at the end . so
and do you know the list about people who don ' want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , " white coat , black art , " i have the habit of saying , " this is my worst mistake , " i would say to everybody from the rescue to the chief of cardiologists , " this is my worst mistake , " blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , " what about your ? " and then i show to him with the microphone . " and i show him the him the .
and then their eyeball expand , they ' re struck in front of their head , then they look down and theyugh hard , and they start telling their stories . and .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , " look , don ' t make the same mistakes that i made . "
what they need is an environment that enables them do it .
what they need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor . and
the newly defined doctor is a man , knows about his humanity , accepts it , is not proud of making mistakes , but does everything to learn something from you so that it can be passed on .
she shares her experiences with others .
it supports when others talk about their mistakes . it
and it shows others their s mistakes , not to just , but in a loving , supportive way so that everybody benefit from it . and
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and if that is the case , people also make mistakes from time to time .
so that the system develop to create backups that make it easier to find mistakes that make people inevitable , and also allows to create loving , supportive spaces where anyone who ' s watches health care can actually address things that are potential mistakes and even be rewarded for them , and that s especially for people like me who should make mistakes and reward for avoid them of them . and of reward be reward them .
my name is brian goldman .
i ' m the newly defined doctor .
i ' m a human . i make mistakes .
i regret that . but ' m am but i ' m trying learn from it , to pass it to others .
i don ' t know what you think of me , but ' s i can live with that . i
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i ' m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it ' s about transformable norms .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i ' m going to tell you three stories before to use the time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was here in 1835 .
you may think that he was hunting fins , but that ' s not true .
, he actually collected fish .
he described one of them as very " typical . "
it was a grouper .
until the ' 80s , it was fished in great scale .
now it ' s on the red list of endangered species .
we ' ve heard many times about the galapagos or other places , but it ' s not very special .
yet , we ' re still coming to the galapagos .
we re still think they ' re originally .
the papers still describe them as pristine .
what has happened here ?
the second story is to illustrate a different concept , the shift size length .
because i experienced it studying a lagoon in west africa in 1971 .
i went there because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate .
and i got a bad sunburn , and i was convinced that i didn ' t really come from there .
it was my first sunburn .
as you can see , the lagoon was surrounded of palms and some mangroves .
there were zebrars about 20 centimeters , black - nose bears , a sub - species of shrirs .
the these sq fish fisheries were very productive , and the fishermen lived very well on and did extremely good in ghana .
when i returned years later , the fish had sw to half of its size .
they grow five centimeters .
they had been genetically mutatted .
they were still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish was also lucky to be there .
so nothing has changed , and yet everything has changed .
my third little story is about my lunch in the introduction of trawling in southeast asia .
in the ' 70s - rather at the beginning of the ' 60s - europe experienced a lot of development projects .
fishing meant countries that have already caught 100 , 000 fish , industrial fishing this rather ugly ship is called mutiara 4 .
i went with that , and we did surveys throughout over the southern south china sea , and especially in the java sea . and
we didn ' t have words for what we got there .
i know now that it was the reason of the ocean .
90 percent of our capture were sponges , other animals that are connected to the reason .
most of the fish , the little dots there on the wreckbble , the wreckage , were coral reef fish .
basically , the bottom of the ocean came on deck and then was thrown back .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition is very fast .
within a year , you do a high , and then you start with commercial fishing .
the reason is changed . from - in this case - a hard bottom or soft corals becomes become muddy crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they weren ' t eaten ; they threw them away because they were dead .
once we started one living .
she had wasn ' t drowned .
then they wanted to kill them , because they could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of debris is collected every by fishermen when they go to areas where that have never been fished .
but it ' s not documented .
we change the world , but we don ' t remember it .
we ad adat our norm values to the new level and don ' t remember what was there .
if you generalize it , this is what happens .
on the y - axis , there are some good things : biodiversity , the number of orca , the green of your country , the water supply .
over time , it changes . it changes , because for people , their actions are quite natural .
each generation looks at the images that they pickb at the beginning of their conscious lives as the standard and will derivem all from it .
the difference is then seen as a loss .
but they don ' t notice the previous losses .
there can be a sequence of changes .
and in the end , they just want to preserve the horic remains .
that ' s truly our goal right now . that
we want to get things that have disappeared , or things that are no longer way they were .
now you could think that the problem was about people who certainly , when they lived in predator societies , killing animals , and who only realized after a few generations what they had done .
because obviously , an animal that has been very common becomes only rare before it emerges .
so you don ' t lose common animals .
you always lose rare animals .
and that ' s why it ' s not seen as a loss .
over time , we focus on the big animals , and in the sea these are the big fish .
they get rarer because we catch them .
over time , there ' s very little fish left , and we think that ' s the norm value .
the question is why people accept that .
well , because you don ' t know it was different .
of course , a lot of people , scientists , will confirm that it was really different .
you ' ll confirm it , because the evidence , as you did in an earlier form is not the way you would like to present the evidence .
for example , there ' s the anecdote that a captain ' s report soundso who observed large fish areas in this area , cannot be used , or usually not fisher scientists normally rated because it he ' s not " scientific . "
so we have a situation that people don ' t know the past , even though we live in educated societies , because they don ' t trust the sources of the past . so
this shows the tremendous role that a marine reserve can play .
because through marine reserves , we ' re basically rec restocting the past .
we are re restocting the past that people can ' t understand because the norms have changed and are very low .
so the people who see a marine reserve and benefit from the insight that allows to resill their norms .
what about the people who can ' t do that because they don ' t have access - the people in the middle east , for example ?
here can , i think the art and the film may fill the gap , as simulations .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there were gray whales - 500 years ago . a
and the colori colors and shades may might may remind you of " avatar . "
if you think about " avatar , " if you think about why people have been so touched by this - except for the smallaha story , why were they so touched by the image world ?
because it calls up something that has been lost in some way .
so my recommendation , the only thing i ' m going to give is to cameron to turn " avatar ii " underwater .
thank you . thank
in the ' 1980ss , in communist east germany , if you had a typewriter , you had to register it in the government .
they also had to register a page with sample text from this typewriter .
the reason for that was the government could trace where the a text came from .
if you found an article with wrong mind , you could find the creator of these those thoughts .
and we in the west couldn ' t understand how anyone could do that , and how much that would limit freedom of speech .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
but if today 2011 you buy a new color laser printer today from the leading laser printer manufacturers and print a page , that page has printed bright yellow spotss on each page in a pattern that clearly frames the page forward on you and your printer . but
this is what happens to us today .
and nobody seems to point up .
and this was an example of in how our own governments are use technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three main sources of online problems that today .
let ' s look at what really happens in the world : we can split the attacks into categories .
we have three main groups .
there are online criminals .
for example here , this is mr . dimitry golubow from kansas in ukraine .
and the of online criminals are very easy to understand .
these people make money .
they use online attacks to make a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several known cases of online millionaires , multi - millionaires , who have made money from attacks .
this is sebastian tsyatsin from tartu in estonia .
this is alfred gonzalez .
stephen watt .
jon sundn .
this is matthew anderson , tariq al - daour and so on and so forth .
these people have come to wealth online , but they acquired it illegally by using , for example , trojans , for , to steal money from our bank accounts while we ' re doing our online banking , or keyloggers who collected our card details when we inputing the keyboard while we ' re buying over an a infected computer online . these .
the u . s . intelligence agency , two ago , bought the swiss account of mr . sam jain two , and on that account there were 14 . 9 million u . s . dollars when it was frozen .
mr . jain himself is on free foot , the location is unknown .
and i ' m saying that today it ' s more likely to be victims of an online crime than a crime in the real world .
and it ' s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
in the future , most of crimes will be online .
the second largest attacker group that we can see today is are is not driven by money .
you ' re motivated by something else - protests , like example , an opinion , or by your audience . they
groups like anonymous have grown up over the last 12 months and have become one of the key players in the field of online attacks .
so these are the three main groups : criminals are doing for money , hackists like anonymous who are res resistance to it , but the last group is nations , governments that are running the attacks .
there are cases , like the diginotar .
it shows an example of what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
diginotar is a full power award from the netherlands - or it was that .
last fall it had to register insultatcy , because diginotar had been hacked .
someone had cracked and hacked the system .
and last week , in a meeting with dutch government officials , i asked one of the leaders of this group if he thought it was possible that people because of the diginotar hack people had died . and
and his answer was , " yes . "
now , how do people die result to a hack ?
diginotar is a certification site .
they sell certificates .
what do you do with certificates ?
well , you need a certificate if you have a website with htttps , with ssl encrypted services , like gmail .
now we all , or many of us , use gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly distributed in totalitarian states like iran , where dissidents are using foreign companies like gmail , because they know that they can trust more them than local providers and they ' re encodepted by ssl connections so the local government can ' t sniff around in their conversations .
but you can , if you go into an foreign one .
fake agencies will hack and print out fake certificates .
and that ' s exactly what happened in the case of diginotar .
what about the arab spring and the things that happened in egypt , for example ?
well , in egypt , the ins forcesoted the headquarters of the egyptian intelligence police in april 2011 , and they found a lot of documents .
in these files there was a folder called " flatfisher .
and in this folder there were notes from a company germany that had sold the egyptian a few programs government that they could - , at a very large scale , stop all the communication of the egyptian citizens . and
they had sold this program for 280 , 000 dollars to the egyptian government .
the corporate headquarters is right here .
so western governments provide totalitarian governments with tools so that they can do against their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , just a few weeks ago what so - called statestrojan found , which was a trojan was used by german government officials to cover their own citizens . for
if you ' re accused suspect in a crime case , pretty safe sure your phone gets tapped in .
but today we ' re way beyond that .
they tap into their internet connection .
they use tools like the state trojan to play their computer with a trojan that allows them to monitor their communication , listen to their online discussions , collect their passwords . they
so if we keep thinking about these things , people ' s obvious answer would be , " ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn ' t affect me because i ' m a brave citizen . so
i don ' t have to worry !
i have nothing to hide . "
and that argument makes no sense . and
privacy needs to be given .
privacy is not debate .
it ' s not a decision between privacy and security .
it ' s a decision between freedom and control .
and while we do today , in 2011 , trust our governments , every right we give is forever passed forever .
and do we trust , do we blindly trust any future government , a government that we may might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions we need to deal with for the next 50 years .
it may seem strange to you , but i ' m a big fan of concrete block blocks .
the first concrete block blocks were made in 1868 , and they came from a simple idea : blocks of cement modules with specified dimensions that fit together .
concrete building blocks became very quickly the most popular building unit in the world .
they got us to build things that were bigger than us were - buildings , bridges , one rock after time .
basically , the concrete building had become the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out of this .
it was called the " automatically connected stone . "
and within a few years , lego moved into every household . and
it ' s estimated that over 400 billion stones have been produced - or 75 stones for every person on the planet .
you don ' t have be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it possible for everyone .
lego basically took the concrete building block , the building block of the world , and made it a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , the same year at bell labs , the next revolution was announced , the next building block .
the transistor was a little plastic unit that would take us from a world of static , stacked building blocks to a world where which everything would be interactive .
like the concrete block , the transistor allows us build much larger , more complex cycles , one stone at a time .
but there ' s a big difference : the transistor was just for experts .
personally , i don ' t accept that the building block of our time is reserved for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers into in the hands of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing littlebits .
let me show you how they work .
littlebits are electronic modules that have a specific function .
they ' re designed to be light , sound , motor and sensor .
and the best part is that they connect to magnets .
so they can ' t put them around wrong .
the stones are color - coded .
green is output , blue is electricity , pink is input , and orange is wire .
so all you have to do is connect a blue one and a green one , and you can build bigger cycles very quickly .
you put a blue one to a green one , and you can make light .
you can put a switch in between , and so you created a little mask .
take the switch out toert in a pulse , which is here , and you ' ve made a little flash .
add this buzzer for additional effect , and you made a noise machine .
i ' m going to stop that . i
beyond simple playing , littlebits is actually quite powerful .
instead of having to program code , wire or sol , littlebits allows them to program with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to accelerate or slow down the flash , just turn this button and it makes the pulse faster or slow down .
the idea behind littlebits is that it ' s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction in the world into a use stone .
lights , sounds , solar elements , motors - everything should be available .
we distributed littlebits to kids and saw them play playing play . we
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is how they start begin to understand the electronics that they surrounds around their everyday life and they don ' t learn in school .
like for a nightlight works , or why the doors of the elevator remain open , or how an ipod responds to touch .
we ' also brought littlebits to design schools .
so for example , we had designers with no experience in electronic things that started play with littlebits as a material .
here we see , with sponge , paper and water bottles , like geo .
a few weeks ago , we brought littlebits to risd , and we gave them to some designers who had no technical experience - just cardboard , wood and paper - and said them , " do something . " a
here ' s an example of a project they did , a movement - controlled ballet cannon .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
it ' s a hummer of play - dough that ' s scared in the darkness .
for these non - engineers , littlebits became another material , electronics just became another material .
and we want to make this material available to everyone .
so littlebits is open source .
you can go to the website , download all the design script and make them yourself .
we want to encourage the world of the creators , the inventors , the contributors , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , belongs to us .
so , go out and start inventing them .
thank you . thank
