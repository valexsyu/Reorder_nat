you know , one of the great connectionss with travel , and one of the joys in cultural research is to live with the people who can remember the old days , who still feeling their past in the wind , touching them on , tasteing them in the bitter leaves of the plants .
just knowing that jaguar shas still traveling beyond the milky way , or the importance of the myths of the elders of the inuit is still important , or that in the himalayas , buddhists are still following the breath of dharma means recalling the central revelation of anthropology , which is the idea that the world that we live in doesn ' t exist in an absolute sense , but only as a model of reality as a consequence of a group of certain ways of adaptation that our ancestors , although successfully , many generations ago .
and of course , we all share the same adaities .
we ' re all born . we birth children .
we go through initiation practices .
we have to deal with the continuedxoistent separation of death , and so we shouldn ' t be surprised that we all sing , dance and produce art .
but what ' s interesting is the unique tone of song , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn ' t matter whether it ' s the pena in the forests of borneo , or the voodoo actes in haiti , or the warriors in the cay desert of northern kenya , the curanders in the alaska , or a caravaca in the middle of the sahara . this happens to be the colleague i traveled to the desert a month , or even a yak shepherd at the tops of the qomo , everest , the mother of the world . the i ,
all these people teach us that there are different wayss , different ways of thinking , different ways of orient on earth .
and this is an idea that , when you think about it , can onlylf you with hope .
together , the thousands of cultures of the world form a network of spiritual and cultural life that en sursulates the earth and is as important for the welfare of the earth as the biological life web that you know as a biosphere .
you can think of this cultural web as an ethre , and ethphere can be defined as the total sum of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations and intuitions that have been produced by human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
the ethnic is the great legacy of humanity .
it ' s the symbol of all we are and what we re do as an incredily knowledge species .
and just as the biosphere has been degraded , this it happened to the population - just at even higher speed .
for example , biologist would dare to say that 50 percent or more of all species are about to extinction , because it ' s just not true . and yet , this - the most apocalyptic scenario in the of biodiversity - is hardly exactly what we ' re known the most optimistic scenario in the cultural biodiversity . for . for .
and the key indicator of that is the extinction of languages .
when each of you were born in this room , 6 , 000 languages spoken on earth .
now a language is not just the sum of the vocabulary , or a set of grammar rules .
a language is an expression of the human mind .
it ' s a means by which the soul of a particular culture to find access to the material world .
every language is like an old - forest of the mind , a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and of those 6 , 000 languages today , as we ' re sitting here in monterey , half of them are longer whispered into the ears of children .
they ' re no taught children anymore , that means , if nothing ' s done , they ' re actually dead .
what could be lonely than covered surrounded by silence , being one of the last of your people who speak your language , have no way to pass on the wisdom of your ancestors , or the hope to expect children ?
and yet , this terriblerible fate actually happen happens to someone somewhere on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , an older man dies and takes the last syllables of an old language into the grave .
and i know that some of you say , " isn ' t it better ? " would the world not be a better place if we all speak one language ? " and i say , " well , let this language be yoruba . let it be classicalian .
let them be kogi . "
and then suddenly they would realize what it would be like if they couldn ' t speak their own language .
so today i want to sort of take you on a journey through the eth , a quick journey through the eth to try to make you understand what has actually been lost .
now , there are some of us who kind of forget that when i say , " different ways of being , i mean really different pos ways of being .
for example , if you take this kid of the barasana in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the anajuan , believe that they mythologicallly brought the milk stream from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
this is a people who don ' t cognitively distinguishe from the colors blue and green , because the sky area is equal to the forest that people depend on .
they have a strange language , and a marriage code is called linguistic exogamy : you have to marry someone who speaks a different language .
all of this is rooted in the mythological past , but the strange thing about these big houses where six or seven languages are spoken because of the mixing , is that you never hear anyone learning a language .
they just listen and then start talking .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes i ' ve ever lived with , the waorani in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people that were first contacted in 1958 .
in 1957 , five missionaries were trying to contact and made a serious mistake .
they took glng photographs of themselves out of the air , which we would consider to a kind gesture , and they forgot that these people from the rainforests in their lifetime had never seen anything two - dimensional their .
they took up these photographs of the forest floor , tried to see behind the face or the figure , found nothing , and concluded that these were business cards of devil , and killed the five missionaries with the spear .
but the waorani did not just kill outsiders with the spear .
they drilled through each other .
54 percent of the deaths happened from drilling .
we went back the genetics for eight generations , and we found two cases of natural death , and when we asked people with strongly something about it , they ad admittedmit that one of the people had gott become so old that he died because of his age , and we killed him with the spear .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest , which was amazing .
their hunters could smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps away and tell which animal species that belonged to .
in the early ' 80s , i got a really amazing task when my professor at harvard asked me if i was interested in going to haiti and iniltrating the secret societies that were the foundation of the strength of duvalies and tonton macoutes and ensure the poison that was used to make zombie slaughters .
in order to make this sense of this , of course , i had to make something about this remarkable belief of vodou knowledge , and voodoo is not a cult of black magic .
on the contrary , it ' s a complex metaphysical worldview .
it ' s interesting . it .
if i asked you to count up the great world religions , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , judaism , or whatever .
a continent is always left , because the presessulation was that sub there was no religious faith in sub saharan , of course there was one , and voodoo is just the remains of these very profound religious beliefs that came across through the tragic diaspora of slavery .
but what makes voodoo so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living give birth the spirits .
the spirits can be swed under the great water , answers to the rhythm of dance to temporarily dispriy the soul of the living , so that the ac , becomes the god for aning moment .
for is , the voodooists like to say , " you your white guys go to church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . "
and because you ' re obsessed , you ' re taken away by the mind . how can you hurt damage to you ?
see these amazing demonstrations : voodoo actes in a trance contact touching glowing coal without burning , an amazing illustration of the ability of the mind to affect the body in a way that it prevents it when it ' s put into a state of extreme arousal .
now , of all the people i ' ve met , the kogi from the sierra nevada of santa barbara in northern africa were the most extraordinary .
descendants of the ancient tyrannian civilization that inhabitedized the caribbean coastal plain of colombia , and as a result of the conquest , this people retreat back into a isolated volcanic mass that rises over the caribbean coastal plain .
in a blood - covered continent , these people were the only people who were never conquered by the spanish .
to this day , they ' re governed by a ritual priesthood , but the education to priesthood is very extraordinary .
the young actess are separated at the age of three and four from their families and trapped in a shadowy world of darkness , in stone huts at the base of the glaciers for 18 years , two periods of nine years , intentionberaally chosen to mimite the nine months of pregnancy that they spent in the lap of their other mother , now spending metamorphorically in the of the big mother ' s lap . living . ' . ' .
and throughout all this time , they ' re culturally introduced into the values of their society , values that sus maintain the claim that their prayers , and only their prayers , the cosmic - or we could say , the ecological - maintain balance .
at the end of this amazing initiation , you one day are suddenly taken out , and for the first time in your life , at the age of 18 , you see a sun eclipse of the sun , and in this crystalous moment of first light , as the sun begins light shining to the hillslines of the astonishingly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything you ' ve learned in abstract confirmed in amazing glory , and the priest comes back and says , " you see ? it ' s really how i told you .
it ' s so wonderful . you have to protect it . "
they call themselves the older brothers , and they say that we , who we are the younger brothers , are responsible for destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
every time we think about indigenous and landscape , we either conggate rousseau and the old myth of the noble wild , which , in its sim , is a racism thought , or to thoreau and say , these people are more connected to nature than we do .
so infant babs are not sentimental , nor are they weakghtened by nostalgia .
there ' s not much room for this in the malaria - malariauted swamps of ashmat or the cold winds of tibet , but they still , through time and ritual , have formed a mysterious nimbus of the earth not based on the idea of being conscio close to it , but on a much more subtle intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist because it breathed into human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid from the alaska growing up in the belief that the mountain is an apu spirit who determine being or fate , will become a very different person being , and have a different relationship with that resource or that place than a little kid from montana who growing up in the belief that a mountain is a bunch of stones that can be dele away .
whether it ' s a place of a mind or a bunch of mineral , it ' s irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor which defines the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of british colombia , believed that these forests were there to be harvested .
that made me another person than my friends of the kwaki who believe that these forests are the refuge of hukuk and the curved celestial snakedile and the cannibal spirits that live on the northern of the world , spirits that they would participate in their hamatsa initiation .
now , when you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it ' s a photograph i just took last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psychoactive drug from the shaman repertoire .
what makes ayahuasca so fascinating is not just the pharmacological potential of this drug , but its processing . it ' s actually really made from two different sources : on the one hand , there ' s this wooden bea that contains a series of aminocars , harmin , harmoline , light hallucinogens - taking this climbing plant alone is kind of as like a blue rammer smoke on its consciousness , but it ' s mixed with the leaves of a bushaw from the family of coffee plants called psychotria viruses . s mixed with the leaves . mixed with leaves of a of . a . that contains . kind of a
this plant has some very strong tryptamine that are similar to serotonin , dimethyltryptamine - 5 and methoxyypethtryylain .
if you ' ve seen the yanomami sniff this stuff , this substance that you make from different species also includes methoxyydethlantryptamin .
sning this pu powder is kind of like being thrown out of a bullet , fuel by renaissance paintings and landing on a sea of electricity .
it ' s not a distortion of reality , it ' s the resolution of reality .
in fact , i even discusseded this with my professor , richard evan shultes , the man who started the psychedelic area with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the ' 30s , and i argued that you couldn ' t recify this tryptamine as hallucinoges , because the moment you feel the effects , you ' re no longer there to experience a hallucination .
but the thing about tryptamines is that they can ' t be taken administeredly because they re naturally derated by a in the human gut enzyme called monoamine - oxidates .
they can only be taken administeredized in combination with some other chemicals that mao des .
now what the fascinating thing is that the procar drugs contained in the bene are mao inhibitors of exactly the kind necessary to potecyfy the tryptamine , so ask yourself .
how can these people from a plant of 80 , 000 species of plants find these two morphologicallynected plants that , if combined in this way , create a kind of biochemical version so that it s larger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great metaphor , trial and mistake , which turns out to be meaningless .
but if you ask the indians say them , " the plant talks to us . "
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasca that you all recognize at a long distance in the forest , that appear as a species to our eyes .
and then you ask them how to explain their taxonomy , and they say , " i thought you understood something about plants .
i mean , you don you ' t know anything at all ? " and i said , " no . "
so , it turns out that you take each of the 17 variations to full moon , and they sing to you in a different tone .
now , that won ' t give you a ph . d . at harvard , but it ' s much more interesting than counting stamina .
now , the problem - the problem is that even those of us who have sympathy for the difficult situation of infant think of them as orgy and colorful , but sort of rest narrowt them to the past as the real world , which is our world progress .
so , the fact is that remember the 20th century , 300 years will be for your wars or technological innovations , but rather an era in which we have been experienced and either actively supported the massive destruction of the biological and cultural biodiversity on earth actively or passively accepted . so the problem is not change .
all cultures have always kept involved in dance with new lives .
and the problem is not technology itself .
the sioux indians heard nothing heard less listening being about sioux than they were asking bows and arrow , when the americans stopped being americans when they were taking horses and horses .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of the ethnic . it ' s power . - the ugly face of rule .
and wherever you look around the world , you ' ll find that these cultures are ' t related to the . these are dynamically living peoples whose existence are displaced by reczing forces that going beyond their capacity to ada , whether it ' s the tremendous deforestation in the homeland of the penan , a nomad people from southeast asia , from sarawak , a people who lived free in the forest before a generation , and nowiliated into crackh and prostitution along the river of , where you can see that even the river is contaminatuted with the mud that seems to nearly almost half of borneo into the south china sea , where the japanese ships see on the horizon , who are willing to fill their ships with raw tree that they ' ve wiped off the forest , or like in the case of the yanomami , where they ' re pathogenicsues who have beenped during the gold rush .
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i ' m doing a lot research recently , you ' ll see the ugly face of political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the phyic extinction of people is generally convicted , but the ethnic , the destruction of people ' lives , is not only not convicted , but celebrated generally and many as part of a development strategy .
and you can ' t understand the suffering tibet if you haven ' t experienced it at the bottom level .
i once traveled with a young colleague 6 , 000 miles from chengdu in west china across southeast tibet to lhasa , and only ' t until i got to lhasa i saw the face behind the statistics that you hear about - 6 , 000 sacred monuments that were transformed into rubble and ash , 1 . 2 million people that were killed by the communists during the cultural revolution .
the father of this young man was identified as a supporter of the panchen lama .
that meant that was killed immediately during the chinese invasion he was killed .
his uncle fled escaped with their holiness to the diaspora that brought people to nepal .
his mother was locked in as a punishment for - be wealthy for the crime .
he was smuggled into the prison at the age of two to hide under her skirt , because she couldn ' t live without him .
the sister who did this brave act was taken into an education camp .
one day , she accidentally hit on a armband hands , and for that overture , she had to into a heavy labor camp for seven years .
the suffering of tibet can be unbearable , but people ' s transive spirit is something memorable .
and at the end , we ' re really with a choice : do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monopolycity or a polychromatic world of diversity ? .
margaret mead , the great anthropologist said before she died , said that it ' s her greatest fear that as we move towards a thread , shapeless , generic worldview , we would we see the entire range of human imagination reduced to a narrowd thinking , but that someday we wake up from a dream , and forgotten that there have ever other possibilities .
and it ' s humbling to think that maybe our species has been existed around for 600 , 000 years .
the neolithic revolution that brought us to agriculture , and at that moment surrender us the cult of the grain of wood , replaced the poetry of the shaman with the poetry of priesthood and created hierarchy , specialization and surplus - happened only 10 , 000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn ' t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we face in the next millennia .
when we ask these countless world cultures about the importance of being human , they answer with 10 , 000 different voices .
and in this song we ' re going toiscover the possibility of to be what we are : people with full awareness who are aware of the importance that all people and the gardens need to be grow a space to thrive , and there are great moments of optimism .
here ' s a photograph i took on the northern end of the baffin islands , when i was going to the narwhal hunting with inuit , and this man , olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government doesn ' t always worked very well with the inuit , and during the 50 , in the establishment of our rule , they were forced to move into settlements .
the this old man ' s grandfather refused .
the family who was afraid of his life took him off all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit are not afraid of the cold . ; they used it to their advantage .
the wheels of their sledes were originally made of fish wrapped in caribbean skin .
the man ' s grandfather was not afraid of the arctic night or the blowing storm .
he hatched out , dropped his pants down out of sea dogboard and defpped in his hand , and as the feces started to freeze , he shaped them into the shape of a knife .
he sprayed spraypers on the sides of the fece knife , and when it was completely frozen , he caught a dog with it .
he ran threw the dog and improvised a dish , took the dog ' skull skeleton and improvised a sled , hurt hit another dog andwneded over the ice pils with the fece knife on the belt .
this is how you can make something out of nothing .
and this is in many ways a symbol of the resistance of the inuit and all the indigenouss in the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in april 1999 full control over an area bigger than california and texas combined .
it ' s our new homeland , and it ' s called nunavut .
it ' s an independent area . they control all the mineral resources .
an amazing example of how a nation , a state , can search and achieve restore rehabilitation with its citizens .
and finally , i think it ' s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who have traveled to these distant targets of the earth , to realize that they ' re not distant at all .
they ' re somebody ' s countries .
they represent parts of human imagination that go back past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the geography of hope .
what we end try to national geographic is that we believe that politicians never do anything .
we believe that pole - we believe pole is not persuasive , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , so we ' re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website gets 35 million hits a month .
156 nations broadcast our tv channel .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we ' re doing a series of trips into the ethnic where we take our audience to places of such cultural wonders that they ' re blinded by what we ' re seen , and hopefully one after another take the central revelation of anthropology : that this world has deserves to exist in different ways , that we can find a way in a truly multicultural plural world where the wisdom of all people to contribute to our shared well - being . the
thank you .
what i ' m going to show you , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we gave microsoft as part of an acquisition just a year ago - this is seamount , and it ' s an environment in which you can either deal locally or remotely with vast amounts of visual data .
we see many lots , many gigabits of digital photos here that can be seamlessly and continuously , wr , in any way .
and it doesn ' t matter how many information we look at , how large these collections are , or how large the images are .
most of them are digital photos of a camera , but this is , for , a scan from the library of congress , and it ' s in a area of 300 megapixels .
it doesn ' t make any difference , because the only thing that canstrat the performance of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen at any moment , it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of non - image data .
this is bleak house by dickens . each column is a chapter .
to prove that it ' s really a text and not an image , we can do something like this to really show that this is a real representation of the text and not an image .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading an e - book .
i wouldn ' t recommend it .
this is a more realistic case . this is a copy from the guardian .
every big image is the beginning of a section .
and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience of reading a real paper copy of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of multiple scales of magnitude medium .
we also did something at the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we designed a false very high resolution display that ' s much higher than a normal display , and we added more content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and this really grabs these ideas to eli eliminate these constraints for the place on the screen .
we hope that doesn ' t mean pop - ups and other nonsense - that shouldn ' t be necessary .
of course , mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i really don ' t want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we ' re going to contribute to this area as well .
but these are all the streets in the u . states s .
up the top of the earth ' image of nasa .
now let ' s get something else out .
this is actually live on the internet . you can check it .
this is a project called photosynth , which really connects two different technologies .
one is seamoullion , and the other is a very good research on computer vision done by noah snavely , a of washington student , under the guidance by steve seitz at the u .w .
and rick szeliski was done from microsoft research - a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it ' s powered by seamount .
you can see this when we create these kinds of views where we can penetrate through images and create this experience of multi - resolution .
but the spatial arrangement of the images actually matters here .
the computer vision algorithms have put these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these images all taken near the grassi lakes in the canadian rockies , and you can see at elements of stabilized slides or panoramic imaging , and these things have all linked spatial relate to . have the
i don ' t know exactly if i still have time to show you other environments .
there are ones that are much more spatial .
i ' d like to go show one of the original data sets of noah s , and this is from an early prototype of photosynth that we first worked on in the summer to show you what i think is really the punchline behind this technology , which is the photosynth technology , and this ' s not necessarily that obvious when you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral of sainte , that was taken entirely only on the computer with images from flickr . just introduce diana in flickr , and you ' ll get pictures of men in t - shirts and in the university buildings and so on , each of these orange cones represents a picture identified as to this model .
so these are all flickr images , and they ' re all in to each other this way .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
. you know , i never believed that i ' m going to work at microsoft .
i ' m very grateful for the reception here .
and i guess you can see that these are a lot of different kinds of cameras : everything is from the mobile phone camera to professional slrs , a pretty large number of them that have all dum plugged together in this environment .
and if possible , i ' ll find some of the weird ones .
many of them are covered by faces and so on .
somewhere here are s a series of photographs - here you are .
this is actually a poster by paris that was actually recorded .
we can move from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is here is that we can do things with the social environment . it ' s collected data from everybody - from the entire collective store of what , visually the earth looks like - and everything ' s connected to other .
all these photographs are connected to each other , and there creates something bigger than the sum of the parts .
you get a model that emerges of the earth .
think of this as the sequel of the work of stephen lawler ' s on virtual earth .
and this is something that ' s growing up of the complexity that people are using it and its utility for the user with the application is .
their own photos are labeled with metadata that another person has written in .
if someone tried trying the out and labeled all these saints and report who they are all , my photo of sainte cathedral is suddenly filled with all this data , and i can use it as a starting point to dive into this room , into this metaph , that use photographs of other people photos , and make a kind of broad modal social experience with using other providers .
and of course , by theduct of all of this are the enormously rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that have been recovered not just by through airplanes or satellite images and so on , but by collective storage .
thank you .
do i understand you right ? your software allows , at a point , over the next few years , all the images that used by someone in the world together are basically linked ?
yes . she does nothing but discovery .
if you want , she creates hyper linkss between the images .
and it does it because of the content in the images .
and this is really exciting when you think about the abundance of semantic information that a lot of these images have .
like when you do a search for images where you type sentences , and the text of the website contains a lot of information about which image that is .
but what if the image connects you to all your images ?
then the amount of semantic cross wiring and the abundance that comes out of it is really enormous . it ' s a classic network effect .
blaise , that ' s really incredible . thank you very congratulations .
thank you very much .
i ' m going to tell you some things from my book that , i hope , will in harmony with other things that you ' ve heard before , and i ' m going to try to make a couple of connections yourself myself if you haven ' t noticed them .
i want to start with what i call " official dogma . "
the official dogma of what ?
the official belief of all western industrialized societies .
the official dogma works like this : if our goal is to maximizing the common good of our citizens , it ' s mostly by maximizing the freedom of the individual .
the reason for that is that freedom within itself is good , valuable , meaningful , an essential condition for the human .
if people have freedom , each of us is for themselves about doing the things that maximize our common good maximize , and no nobody has to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is toize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more common good they have .
this is , i think , so deeply embedded in our water supply that nobody one would think of questioning it .
and it ' s also deeply embedded in our lives .
i ' m going to give you some examples of what allows us modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say a little bit about lettuce sandwich .
there are 175 dressings in my supermarket , if you don ' t count the 10 different extra olive oil and 12 different lemon acids that you could buy to make a large number of own salad , in the unlikely case that none of the 175 in the store are right for you .
so that ' s what the supermarket is .
and then they go to the consumer electronics business to putmble a stereo - speakers , cd player , cassette player , radio , amplifier - and in this electronics business , there are so many stereos .
we can assemble 6 . 5 million different stereo systems of the components that are offered in this business .
you have to admit that ' s a big choice .
in other areas , the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , when you could have any phone provider you wanted , as long as he came from ma bell .
they rented their phone . they didn ' t buy it .
one consequence of that was that the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now have almost an infinite range of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is the one in the middle - mp3 player , nose - hair shirt and cream bru lightkel .
and if you haven ' t seen this in your business so far , you can be sure you ' re going to be soon .
and what it does is it gets people go into the business and ask that question .
now , you know what the answer to that question is ?
the answer is , " no . "
it ' s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn ' t do too much .
in other aspects of life , that are much more significant than buying items , the same explosion of choices is .
health - it ' s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , we could do a , or we could do b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ? . ?
and they say , " doctor , what should i do ? "
the doctor says a has these benefits and risks , and b has these benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ? .
and if you say , " if you were me , doctor , what would you do ? "
the doctor says , " but i ' m not you . "
the result is - we call it " patient autonomy . " it sounds like a good thing , but in reality ' s a shift in the burden in responsibility for making decisions from someone who knows something - namely the doctor - to somebody who doesn ' t know anything and is most likely sick and therefore not in the best order to make a decision - namely the patient .
there ' s a huge marketing for prescription drugs for people like you and me that which , when you think about it , doesn ' t make any sense at all , because we don ' t buy them .
why do they advertise for us if we can ' t buy ?
the answer is , you expect us to call the doctor the next morning and ask for to a change in the prescription .
something as profound as our identity is a matter of choice how this slide supposed to show .
we don ' inherit identity , we invent it .
and we often reinvent ourselves as we want .
that means every day when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the standard assumption was that almost everybody had one , and that they got married as quickly as they could , and then got as quickly children as they could .
the only real choice was who , not when , and not what they did after that .
today , everything is easy to have .
i teach wonderful smart students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and not because they ' re less smart , and not because they ' re less careful .
it ' s because they ' re dealing with other things , they ask themselves , " should i marry or not ? should i get married now ?
should i get married later ? should i first have children , or should i make a career ? "
they ' re all engaging questions .
and you ' re going to answer these questions whether that means doing all the tasks that i ' m going to you and not getting a good grade in my class .
and in fact , you should do that . these are important questions to answer .
work - we ' re blessed , as carl illustrated , with the technology that allows us to work every minute from every place on the planet every day - except to the randolph hotel .
by the way , there ' s a corner i ' m not going to tell you about , where wireless network works on .
i ' m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means to have this incredible freedom of choice that we have in make decisions about terms of work , over and over again over again , whether we should work or not work .
we can watch our kids play football , and we have our cell phone on one hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and we probably our laptop on our lap .
and even though they ' re all turned off , every minute we watch our child mutilating a football game , we also ask ourselves , " should i take that call ?
should i answer that email ? should i write this letter ? "
and even though the answer to the question " no , " it ' s certainly going to shape your experience of your kid ' s game is very different from than it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a matter of choice .
and the world that we lived in looked like this .
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not all was a matter of choice .
and the world that we live in now looks like this .
and the question is , is that good news or bad news ?
the answer is " yes . "
we all know ' s good about this , so i ' m going to talk about ' s bad about it .
all of these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
one effect , paradoxically , is that it paralyzes instead of liberating .
with so many options you can choose , it ' s very hard people to even decide .
i ' m going to give you another dramatic example of this , a study of investing in voluntary retirement .
a colleague of mine had access to investment records from vanguard , the giant fund of about a million employees and about 2 , 000 different jobs .
and what she found was per 10 investment funds that the employer offered , dropped participation by two percent .
they offer 50 investment funds - 10 percent less employees participate than if they only offered five . why ?
because it ' s 50 investment funds selected , it ' s so hard to decide which one to choose that they delay it to tomorrow .
and then morning , and then morning , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never comes .
do you understand that ' s t not just that people to eat dog food when they go to retirement because they don ' t have enough money to spend , it also means that decisions are so hard that they miss large investment to from their employers .
by not participating , they spend up to 5 , 000 dollars a year on the employer , who had been happy to multirodher their contribution .
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
you really want to make the decision right if it ' s all for all the ages , right ?
they don ' t want to choose the wrong investment fund , or even the wrong lettd balance .
so that ' s the one effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome paralysis and make a decision , we end less happy with the outcome of the choice than if we had the opportunity to choose between fewer possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is because by the vast selection of different saladlines when you buy one , and it ' s not perfect - and , which salad is perfect ? it ' s easy to imagine that you could have made a different decision that would have been better . and what happened is this visually alternative leads you to regret the decision , and that regret negatively to the happiness you had from you made decision , even if it was a good decision . made
the more options there are , the easier it is s impossible to regret all , that ' s disappointing for the choice you make .
second , what economists call cost of .
dan gilbert made a big point this morning by telling how much the way we judge things depends on what we compare it .
well , if there are a lot of alternatives to consider , it ' s easy to imagine attractive properties of alternatives that exclude , which makes you less happy with the alternatives that you ' ve chosen .
here ' s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but here ' s what you should have thought .
here are a couple on the brooklyn .
very expensive housing estate .
beautiful beach . great day . you have it all for yourself .
what could be better ? " damn , " the man thinks , " it ' s august .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is gone .
i could park right in front of my house . "
and he spends two weeks on following the thought that he missed the opportunity to have day after day , a great parking lot .
costs of opportunity reduce the happiness we get from our choice , even though what we ' ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more choice options there are for choice , the more attractive properties of that choice are considered at the cost of .
here ' s another example .
now , this cartoon makes some statements .
he makes a statement about living in now , and maybe about things .
but one an important point he does is , whenever you choose to do one thing , you don ' t decide choose to do other things .
and these other things may have a lot of attractive traits , and it will make what they ' re going to do less attractiveing .
third , escalating expectations .
this is what me when i wanted to change my jeans .
i ' m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time when there were only jeans of one kind , and they bought them , and they poorly , they were incredibly uncomptaable , and if they carried them long enough and often wash enough , they started feeling like " ok . "
so i went to buy new jeans after many years of wearing the old jeans , and i said , " i ' d like some jeans , here ' s my big . "
and the salesman said , " do you want sl , slightly open or wide ?
do you want buttons or sticks ? washed stone brick or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
you want to cut it down far down , fliphy , blah , blah , blah , . " and so on he said .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered , i said , " i ' d like the way that used to be the only species . "
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying testing all these damn jeans , and left the business - and i ' ll tell the truth - with the best appropriate jeans i ever had .
i had better . all this choice allowed me to do better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it to myself .
the reason i felt worse , with all these possi available , my expectations for what a good couple jeans , went up .
i had very low expectations . i didn ' t have concrete expectations than they were only there in one way .
when they came in 100 species , damn it , one of them should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn ' t perfect .
and so i compared what i haden to what i expected , and what i had was disappointing compared to what i expected .
adding opportunities to people ' s lives inevitably increases the expectations that people have about how good these possi will be .
and that leads to less satisfaction with the results , even though the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this , because if you were , you didn ' t know what this all about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that once time everything was better than anything was worse , than when anything worse , it was possible for people to experience experiences that were a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world that we live in - we wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as an expectation - the best thing you can ever hope for is that things are as good as you expect them .
they ' re never surprised , because their expectations , my expectations , are awsh .
the secret to happiness - that ' s what you all came up with - the secret to happiness is low expectations .
i want to say - a short autobiographical moment - that i ' m married to a woman , and she ' s really wonderful .
i couldn ' t have done it better . i couldn ' t leave down .
but settle down isn is ' t not always such a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of buying a bad - sitting jeans if there ' s only one way to buy , is that if you ' re unhappy , and you ' re wondering why who ' s responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what could you have done ?
when hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and you buy one that ' s disappointing , and you ask why , who ' s responsible ?
is it also so clear that the answer to the question is you .
they could have done better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the window , there ' s no excuse for mistakes .
and so when people make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about it , they accuse themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world over the last generation .
i think a significant - not the only , but a significant contribution to this explosion of depression , and also suicide - is that people have experienced that are disappointing because their standards are so high , and then if they have to explain these experiences , they think it ' s their fault .
and so the balance result is that generally we ' re generally doing better , objectively , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official dogma , the one that we all think is right is completely wrong . it ' s not true .
there ' s no question that some choice is better than no , but it doesn ' t follow that more choice is better than some choice .
there ' s a magical amount . i don ' t know what it is .
i ' m pretty sure that we ' ve missed that point for a long time in select improving our public good .
now , as a fundamental question - i ' m almost done - as a basic question , the thing about , what allows makes all this choice in the industrialized societies is material wealth .
there are a lot of places in the world , and we ' ve heard about a lot of them whose problem is not too much choice .
their problem is they have too little .
so the things i ' m talking about are a strange problem of modern , rich western societies .
and what ' s so frustrating and annoying : steve levitt told you yesterday about how these expensive and hard - to install car seats don ' t help . it ' s a waste of money .
what i ' m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions - it ' s not easy that they don ' t help .
they even hurt .
they make we stand worse .
if something of what allows people of our society to make decisions to the societies where people have chose too little choices , would not only improve people ' s lives , but our dig would also be improved .
economists call this a pv improvement adization .
income distribution will make everybody to do better - not just the poor - because all this big choice is troubles us .
finally , please read this cartoon , and , a sophisticated person , says , " ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don ' t know anything possible in this goldfish glass . "
imped imagination , a short - sighted view of the world - and that ' s the way i first read it .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came up think that the fish knows something .
because the truth is that if you break the goldfish glass , so that everything is possible , you don ' t have no freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the goldfish glass so that everything is possible , you reduce happiness .
they increase paralysis and reduce happiness .
everybody needs a goldfish glass .
this is almost with total security - possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but lying of a metaphorical goldfish glass is a recipe for misery , and , i guess , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i ' ve talked about some of these projects earlier before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we ' starting from a new point : we ' ve digitized biology , and now we ' re trying to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by designing and building new lives .
we ' ve always tried to ask important questions .
what is life ? it ' s something i think many biologists have tried to understand and at different levels .
we ' ve tried different ways to simplify it down to the minimal components .
we ' veitized almost over 20 years , and when we sequenced the human genome , the shift moved from the analog world of biology to the digital world of computers .
now we ' re trying to ask , can we regenerate life , or can we create new life from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma teitalium , which has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we ' ve tried if we can do that with a smaller genome .
we ' ve managed to avoidp about a hundred genes of the 500 or so that are here .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple compared to ours . trust me , that ' s simple . but if we look at all of these genes that we can eliminate one after another , it ' s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that it ' s the only way forward is to actuallythesize this chromosome , which allows us to differenti change the individual components and therefore ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we synthesize a chromosome ?
is chemistry to make these really big molecules which has never been made before ?
and , if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome , by the way , is just a piece of inert chemical material .
our steps in digitizing life were exponential .
our ability to write genetic code has evolved very slowly , but is still increased , and our last point would now put on an exponential curve .
we started 15 years ago .
it actually took a few years starting with a bioethiciical review before we did the first experiments .
it turns out , dna synization is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it ' s a degunial process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to develop a new method where we could to put these little pieces together and fix the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it ' s a little virus that kills bacteria .
we made little pieces , we made a error correction , and we had a dna molecule of about 5 , 000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it into a bacterium , and the bacterium started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were then released by the cells and came back and killed e . coli .
recently i talked to the oil industry , and they said they were better this model .
they laughed more than you do here .
so we think this is a situation in which software can actually build your own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go a lot further . we wanted to build an entire bacterial chromosome - it has more than 58 , 000 letters of genetic code , so we thought we ' d build it in cassette the size of the virus , so we could change the size of the cassette to understand what the individual components of a living cell .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be error free .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the error rate was one error per 10 , 000 base pairs .
we found 30 mistakes it res sequenced . if we used the original sequence , it would never been possible to go up .
part of the design is to make pieces that are 50 letter long and have to overlap with other 50 - letter pieces to build smaller sub - units so fit them .
we have unique elements in here .
you may have heard that we put watermarks in it .
think about it : we have a four - letter code : a , c , g and t .
triplets of these letters - these letters code about 20 amino acids , and here ' s a single determination for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
initially , we just signed .
some people were disappointed that it wasn ' t poetry .
we designed the pieces that we could just break them with enzymes . there are enzymes that repair them and rec assemble them .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that had five to seven thousand letters , putting them together into 24 , 000 letter pieces and to put them back together , up to 72 , 000 .
in each step , we made these pieces in excess , so we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process , what they ' re ll see in a minute .
we ' ve tried to get to the point of automation .
so , this looks like a basketball play .
if we get to these really big pieces - with over 100 , 000 base pairs - they won ' t just grow in e . coli . it ' s excee beyond all the possible of modern molecular biology , and so we turned to other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism called homologous recombination , which biology uses to repair dna that can put those pieces together .
here ' s an example of this . there ' s a organism called myocococcus , thats three million rads of radiation .
you can see in the upper top field that his chromosome just falls apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything bleonne back way it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely dry , they can even live in the vacuum .
i ' am absolutely sure that life can exist and move in space looking for aquatic conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there ' s a lot of this out there .
here ' s a picture of the molecule that we made using these processes - in fact , we only used yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in . yeast then automatically puts them together .
this is not an electron microscope shot ; it ' s a regular microscope picture .
it ' s such a big molecule that we can actually see it with the light microscope .
these are that six seconds span .
this is the publication we just recently finished .
that ' s over 58 , 000 letters of genetic code . it ' s the largest molecule with defined structure ever created by humans .
it has a molecular ring of over 300 million .
if we put it at a size of 10 and no distance , it would contain 142 pages just to express that genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , that ' simple with a virus . it ' s much more easier to deal with bacteria .
it ' s just as simple if you do in eukaryots as we are : you just take out the nucleus and you put another one in it , and that ' s exactly what you ' ve all heard about cloning .
in archae bacteria , the chromosome is embedded in the cell , but recently we ' ve been shown that you can do a complete transplant of one chromosome from one cell to the other and activate it .
we cleaned the chromosome of a microbicl species . roughly speaking , these two are as far apart as humans and mice , and we put some extra genes so we could select this chromosome , and we decoraded it with enzymes to destroy all the proteins . and it was very amazing when we put it into a cell - and they ' ll value our very sophisticated graphs here . estimate . a
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought this was the end , but we tried to get the process a little further .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we find all the species of species here that have captured a second chromosome , or a third from anywhere , each time add thousands of characteristics in a second to a species .
so people who think of evolution as a gene that gets is changed at a point have missed a lot from biology .
there are enzymes called restriction enzymes that actually digest dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell has no none ; the chromosomes that we ' ve put already have .
it was exsipelleed in the cell , and realized that the other chromosome as a foreign material , digest , and so we ended up with just one cell with a new chromosome .
it turned blue because of the genes that we had put in .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species and converted into a new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes changed - when we read the genetic code , it that was exactly what we transferred .
it may sound like genomic almia , but , by shift the software dna , we can change things quite dramatically .
now i ' ve argued that this is not genesis - this is based on 3 . 5 billion years of evolution .
and i ' ve argued that maybe we may be creating a new form of cambrian explosion in which there could be massive new species based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it ' s pretty obvious about what we need .
we ' ve grown growing from six and a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet for each who that existed in 1946 ; within 40 years it will be four .
we have problems with food , fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6 . 5 billion people .
it ' s going to be a challenge to offer this for nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , 30 plus billion barrels of oil . that ' s a hundred million barrels a day .
when we think about biological processes , or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there ' s all the co2 of this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
now we have , from our discoveries from around the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
the electronics industry had a dozen components , and look at the diversity that came out of it .
we ' re primarily to the limits of biological reality and the limits of our imagination .
we have technologies today because of these rapid synthesis techniques to do what we call combinatorial genetics .
we now have the ability to build a big robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine making these 20 million different genes or optimizing these processes to make oct or drugs create new vaccines , we can change with a very small team more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it ' s just selection . we can select by life , production of chemicals or fuel production , vaccine production and so on .
this is a recording of real design software that we ' re working on , where you can actually sit down and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don ' t necessarily know what it ' s going to look like . we know exactly what their genetic code is going will look like .
we ' re now focusing now on fourth generation fuels .
you ' ve recently seen corn into ethanol , which is just a bad experiment .
we have second - generation and third generation fuel that will come out soon that will have much higher sugar , like oct or different kinds of butanol .
but as we think , the only way biology is going have a huge impact without further increasing in the cost of food or limitation of their availability is when we see co2 as a source material , and so we ' re working on cells that go this way .
and we think we ' re going to be the first have fourth generation fuel , in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is a organism that we described in 1996 .
it lives in the deep sea , about a and a half mile deep , with almost boiling water temperatures .
it converts co2 into methane use hydrogen as a source of energy .
we study if we can use stored co2 that could be brought to production sites , convert co2 into fuel to drive this process .
within a short period of time , we believe we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have - moderate goals like replaceing the whole petrochemical industry . right . if you couldn ' t do that at ted , where else ? to become a primary source of energy .
but in the same thing we ' re working on apply the same approaches for developing vaccines .
you saw with flu this year , we ' re always a year back it and have a dollar too little when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that this can be changed by creating recombinant vaccines in advance .
that s what the future might look like with changes , the evolutionary tree can be accelerated today with synthetic bacteria , archaea , and perhaps eukaryots .
we ' re light years from improving people , and our goal is just that we have a chance to survive long enough to do . thank you very much .
at the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back and tell you how the machine works .
so now it ' s here . and for those of you who were ' t there at the time , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted - 27 miles diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that existed less than a billionth of a second after the universe - up to 600 million times in a second .
it ' s just incrediblyly ambitious .
this is the machine below geneva .
we take pictures of these mini big bangs in detectors .
this is what i ' m doing on . it ' s called the atlas detector - 44 meters in diameter , 22 meters in diameter .
here ' s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction so you can see the scale .
on september 10 last year , the machine launched the first .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it caused huge screams in the control room .
it ' s a picture of the first radiation particle that went all the way around the lhc , then deliberately collide with a part of the lhc to have a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture on september 10 , we knew that the machine works , which is a great triumph .
i don ' t know whether this created the biggest bang , or this when someone went to the google page and found the front page like this .
it means that we ' ve achieved a cultural impact alongside scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires here - these golden wires here .
these wires conduct 13 , 000 thousand amplbls when the machine is high - speed .
now , the engineers amongst you will look at you and say , " no , you don ' t . these are little wires . "
they can do that because if you cool them very far , they become what call superconductors .
so at minus 271 degrees , colder than the space between the stars , these wires can handle tension .
in one of the connections , between over nine thousand magnets at the lhc , there was a manufacturing effect .
so the wires heated in a , and 13 , 000 thousand traffic suddenly encountered electrical resistance .
this was the result .
now , this is even more amazing if you imagine that the magnets weigh over 20 tons and move around by about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove them of what we did .
we re conditioned them , we repaired them .
they ' re all back on their way .
by the end of march , the lhc will be functional again .
we ' re going to turn it on , and we expect to collect first data in june or july , and continue our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in a way , such accidents again sparking the debate about the value of science and engineering at such limits . it ' s easy to reject that .
i think the fact that it ' s so hard , the fact that we reach beyond our limits is the value of things like the lhc .
i ' m going to leave my final words to an english scientist . humphrey davey , who , i gu when he defended the useless experiments of his apprentice , his apprentice was michael faraday , said this : " nothing is so as dangerous to the development of the human mind than as to assume that our scientific beliefs are final , that there are no mysteries in nature , that our triumphs are fullful , and that there are no new worlds to conquer . " . " no new
thank you .
i ' m a writer .
writing books is my profession , but course , of it ' s more than that .
it ' s also my great lifelong love and fascinamenttion .
and i don ' t expect that to ever change .
but something weird has happened in my life and my career that led me completely rethink my connection to this work .
this strange event was that i recently wrote a book - a biography called - eat , pray , love - that , determined , unlike than all of my previous books , for some reason , went out into the world and became a big mega - event , international best - selling thing .
the result is that no matter where i come , i am treated as if i am dedicated to demise .
seriously - altar to demise !
for example , you come very concerned to me and say , " don ' t you afraid you ' re never going to cross that success ?
don ' t you be afraid passing on your whole your life and never again create a book that anyone in the world care ? never again ?
okay , that ' s really courage .
but it would be worse if i didn ' t remember that over 20 years ago , when i first told me that i wanted to be a writer , i had been facedd with the same kind of feared response .
people said , - aren ' t you afraid to never succeed ?
don ' t you afraid that the humiliation of a rejection kills you ?
do you not afraid that you carry do this craft for your life and never come out to of it and you ' re going to die on a junk pile of bur dreams - your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure ?
something that like , you know .
the answer - the short answer to all these questions is - yes .
yeah , i ' m afraid of all these things .
and i always had them .
and i ' m scar afraid of a lot more things that no one would thinkpect .
like algae - and other frightening things .
but when it comes to writing , i ' ve been thinking about it recently and i wondering , why ?
is that rational ?
is it logical that expected someone should be to be afraid doing the work that they feel dedicated to ?
and what ' s about the creative enterprises is that they make us insecure about the each other state of each - in a way that other professions don ' t ?
my father , for example , was a chemist , and i can ' t remember any a situation in his 40 years as a chemist where he was asked if he was afraid to be a chemist .
with your chemist block , john - how about you about that ?
it just didn ' t happen , you know ?
but to be fair - the group of chemists group have not receiveden the reputation of alcoholic manic depressed people over the .
but we writers seem to have this kind of reputation , but not just the writers , but the creatives of all genres seem to have that reputation , mentally incredibly unstable .
all you have to do is look at the bitterim deaths of really great heads just the 20th century who died young and often died by their own hand .
and even those who didn ' t actually have suicide seemed to be been really neglected by their talents .
norman mailer said just before he died in his last interview : - each of my books killed me a little bit further .
an extraordinary statement you can make about your life work .
but we don ' t even shhis when we hear someone say something like this , because we ' ve known these kinds of statements for so long , somehow we ' ve internalized the idea so and collectively accepted that creativity and suffering somehow naturally , and that art - at the end - always leads to the soul evil .
the question i want to ask to everybody here today is : is this idea completelyly fine for you ?
do you feel comfortable with it ? because at just a centimeter away , i don ' m t feel comfortable with that idea at all .
i think find them disgusting .
and i find it dangerous , and i don ' t want to watch it s taken adopted into the next century .
i think it ' s better if we encourage our great creatives to live .
and i definitely know that - in my situation - it would very dangerous for me to start downloading down this dark path of guessulation sort of - especially in the circumstances that i ' m in my career .
that means - look : i ' m pretty young . i ' m only about 40 years old .
i might have another 40 years in me .
and it ' s extremely likely that everything i ' m going to write right now is rated by the world as the work that came after the subsequent success of my last book , right ?
i ' m saying it straight , because we ' re all kind of friends - it ' s extremely likely that my greatest success is ahead behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts you can get someone to start drinking gin at 9 a in the morning , and i don ' t want to .
i ' d rather continue doing this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after a while of reflect , it seems to me that in order to continue writing , i have to design a kind of protective psychological framework .
somehow , i ' from now , i find a way to a safe distance between me and my very natural complainty about how what the response to the written will be .
while i ' ve been looking for models this last year to do that , i ' ve also been looking in the past , and i ' ve also trying to find other societies to see if they might have better or more reasonable ideas about it than we do , how to help creatives deal with the emotional risks associated with creativity . and .
this search led me to old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close .
but in ancient greece and rome , people didn ' t believe that creativity comes from people , ok ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of divine servant spirit coming from a distant , unknown source to people - for unseengina , unknown reasons .
the greeks called these divine servants - spirits of creativity - demons .
socrates known by socrates that he believed he had a demon who told him wisdom from a distance .
the romans had the same idea , called this kind of bodyless creative mind - genius .
that ' s great . the romans didn ' t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical divine creature believed literally lived in the walls of an artist ' s studio - sort of like dobby , the homem - who would came out and help the artist kind of invisible and shape the result of the work .
this is brilliant - there it is , there ' s the distance i talked about - the psychological construct that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew it worked that , right ?
the artist of the ancient was protected from certain things , like , too much narcissism , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn ' t feel everything for you . everybody knew that you had this bodyless genius that helped you .
if when your work worked - not entirely your fault , right ?
everybody knew your genius was a little paralyzed .
so how people in the west really thought about creativity for a long time .
and then the renaissance came , and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let ' s put the human individual at the center of the universe - over all the gods and mysteries - and there ' s no room for mystic creatures who take commands of divinity .
it ' s the beginning of rational humanism , and people began to believe that creativity was completely from their own individual .
for the first time in history , people call this or this artist a genius - rather than having a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think allowing a mere person to thinks he or she is like the vessel , like the pond and the essence and the source of all divine , creative , unknown , infinite mystery is a little too much responsibility to treage them up to a fragile human psyche .
it ' s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
it distors and distortes whole egos , and it creates all these unithiginable expectations for success .
i think that this success pressure has destroyed our artists for the last 500 years .
and if that ' s true - and i think it ' s true - the question is .
can we change it ?
maybe back to an ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and the mystery of the creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can ' t just eradicate the mind of 500 years of rational humanism in an 18 - minute talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience who would register really legitimate scientific doubts about the idea of - basically fairies who follow people and apply magic to their projects and so on .
i ' m probably not be able to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to ask out is , why not ?
why not think about it way ?
because it makes as much sense as anything i ' ve ever heard about when it comes to explaining the absolutely crazy - moodsness of the creative process .
a process that , like anyone who ' s ever tried to do something - so in other words , actually everyone here - ' t always be reasonable .
in fact , sometimes he can sometimes feel really paranormal .
i had such a encounter recently when i met the extraordinary american poet ruth stone , who is now over 90 , but who was been throughout her life a poet . she told me that when she was up out in village virginia , she working on in the fields . she said she could feel and hear a poem coming about the landscape coming to her . i .
she said it would was like a thunderous train of air .
he would roll over them country .
she felt when it came , because it would make the earth under her feet .
she knew that in that a moment a moment , she could only do one , and that was - in her words , - running like the devil .
she ran like the devil the house while she was chased by this poem , and it was all that she had to a piece of paper and a pencil enough so that she could as it wased through her , she could catch it and hold it on the paper .
in other paintings , she wasn ' t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn ' t reach the house , and the poem didn ' t roll through her , and she missed it . she said it was going to move across country and , as she said , look for another poet .
and then there were these moments - i ' ll never forget the part - she said there were moments when she almost missed it .
so , she runs to the house and looks for the paper , and the poem goes through her , and she reaches a pencil just as it goes through her , and then - she said - it was like reaching with her other hand and getting it .
she caught the poem on his tail and pulled it back into her body and took it onto the sheet of paper .
at these instances , the poem appeared perfectly and intact on the paper - but backwards - from the last word to the first .
when i heard that , i thought - this is creepy - that ' s exactly how my creative process is going on .
it ' s not like my creative process - i ' m not the channel !
i ' m a mu . in order to work , i have to get up at the same time and sweat , recover and get really uncomfortable .
but even , in my mu age , i sometimes stretched this thing .
and i guess many of you have done that as well .
even i had work or ideas that coming through from a source me that i can ' t identify .
what is that thing ?
and how do we relate it without losing our minds it , but even maintaining oursel with mental health in opposite ? . ?
for me , the best living example of how to do this is the musician tom waits . i got to interview him for a magazine a few years ago .
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? for most of his life , tom was the embodiment of the tortured modern artist who was trying to master dominate these uncontrollable creative impulses that lived in him and to cope with them .
but then he got older and quieter . he told me that one day he was driving on a highway in los angeles , and everything changed for him .
he drove at high speed when he suddenly hears a little piece of a melody that , as it is often in inspirations , is agoniingly difficult to grasp for to him , and he wants want it . it ' s gorgeous . he ' s crawick after it , but he can ' t touch it .
he doesn ' t have a piece of paper , he doesn ' t have a pen , he doesn ' t have a cassette tape recorder .
so he starts sending up this old anty inside him , like - i ' m going to lose this thing , and i ' m ll be chaseed by this song forever .
i ' m not good enough , i can ' t do it .
but instead of panicked , he just stopped .
he ended the whole thought and did something completely new .
he just looked in the sky and said , " sorry , can you see that i ' m driving ?
do i look like i was just writing down a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a cheaper moment if i can take care of you .
if not don ' , somebody else today .
go and torture leonard cohen .
his whole work process has changed after that .
not the work itself . it was still often as dark as ever .
but the process and the severe firection around him was suspended when he took the genius out of himself , where he didn ' t do nothing but anger and left him back to where he kind of came from , he realized that it didn ' t have to be internalized , agonizing thing .
there could be a strange , wondrous , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the strange external thing that wasn ' t quite tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a little bit changed the way i worked , and it saved me .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the writing process of - eat , pray , love - and i fell into one of these mists of doubt that we all fall into when we work on something and it doesn ' t work . you start to think it ' s to be a disaster . this is going to the worst book ever written . this . this . this .
not just bad , but the worst of ever .
i started thinking , i should just push the project .
but then i remember tom been speaking in the sky , and i tried .
so i took my look from the manuscript , and i spoke my comment towards a empty corner of the room .
i spoke said loudly , - listen , you thing , you and i both know , if this book isn ' t brilliant , it ' s not entirely my fault , right ?
because you can see that i invest everything i have . i don ' t have more than that .
so if you want to do better , you have to break up here and make your share of agreement .
okay . but if you don ' t that - you know what , then the hell with it .
i ' m going keep writing anyway , because that ' s my job .
and i want to ask paraphrase that i was here for my part of my job .
because , at the end , it ' s like the this . centuries ago , in the deserts of north africa , people have gatheredher up to with sacred dances and music that were held for hours - until the dawn .
these celebrations were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but every once in a while , very rarely , something special happened : one of the actors actually became supercendent .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know that all ' ve all in your life have all seen a performance .
it was like time stop and the dancer was would step through a kind of gate . he did nothing than he ' d ever done it before - 1 , 000 nights before . but everything got together .
and all of a sudden , he no longer seemed pure human .
it was lit from inside and lit from the bottom , and everything lit up through a divine fire .
when this happened at then , people knew what that was . they called it his name .
they put their hands together , and they started singing : - allah , allah , allah , god , god , god .
this is god , you know ?
interesting historical footnote : when the carrots of southern spain , they brought this practice . and the sounds changed over the centuries from - allah , allah , allah - to - oil , oil , oil - that you still hear in sword and flamenco dances .
if a actor in spain did something impossible , something magical - allah , oil , oil , allah , great , brave - incredible , it is : a fleet look at god .
and that ' s great , because we need that .
but the tricky part follows the next morning , when the dancer himself wakes up and realizes it ' s 11 o ' clock on a tuesday - and he ' s no longer carrying a spark of god in .
he ' s just an aging mortal with painful knees , and maybe he ' s never going go up to those heightss again .
and maybe will call god ' s name again when he turns , but what should he do with the rest of his life ?
that ' s hard . that .
this is one of the most painful corrections of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn ' t have to be quite that full of embarras if you didn ' t believe at the beginning that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence came from you .
if you may just believe that you ' re a loan - from an unimaginable source of a learned period of your life that ' s passed on to somebody else when you ' re done doing it .
when we start thinking about it that way , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and so i certainly in the last few months , while i ' m been working on the book that ' s about to come soon - as the dangerous , scary , highly expected successor of my past success .
what i have to tell myself when i get mad about it is , don ' t be afraid .
don ' t be daunted .
just do your job .
keep be there for your contribution , whatever it may be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
when the stupid divine genius that you ' re on aside decides to show a littlech of wonder through your effort for a brief moment , then - ole !
and if not , still dance your dance .
and - oil ! - for you despite all of that .
i believe it , and i feel like we should teach it .
- ole ! - for you , despite all of this , just for having the mere human love and the self nature of being there .
thank you .
thank you .
ole !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice caps , which was approximately three million the size of the bottom 48 states for years , has declined by 40 percent .
but that doesn ' t seem strong enough express the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn ' t show the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic ice caps is the beating heart of our global climate system .
it grows in winter and shrinks in summer .
the next slide i ' m going to show you is a time - lapse shot that ' s happened over the last 25 years .
the permanent ice is marked in red .
as you can see , it grows on the dark blue marked . this is the annual ice in the winter , and it shrinks in summer .
the so - called permanent ice , five years old or older , is almost like blood coming out of the body here .
in 25 years , it will have gone from here to here .
this is a problem because warming reveals the frozen reason around the arctic ocean , where there ' s a huge amounts of frozen carbon that when it comes up , is converted from microbes to methane .
compared to the total amount of climate - changinging materials in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we reach that critical point .
already today , in some flat lakes in alaska , methane gas melting itself from the water itself .
professor katey walter at the university of alaska traveled with another group to another flat lake last winter .
wow !
you ' re okay . the question is , how will we do ?
and one reason is that this enormous heat reservoir heats greenland from the north .
this is a annual sea water stream .
but the volumes are much larger than ever before .
this is the kangaroo river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how the sea level is rises through land here is it flows into the sea .
these rivers are increasing rapidly .
at the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest ice mass on the planet .
last month , researchers reported that the entire continent now has a negative ice balanceprint .
and the west atlantic world , which has appeared over a few underwater islands , is particularly strong in melting .
that ' s 20 feet of sea level sea , just like greenland .
in the himalayas , the third largest ice mass , you see new lakes up there that were glaciers a few years ago .
40 percent of all people in the world get half of their drinking water out of that melt .
in the alaska , this glacier is the water source for this city .
the amount of water has expandedd .
but when they sealse , most of the drinking water will drop away as well .
in california , a 40 percent reduction in the snow in the sierra .
this is about the store basins .
and the predictions how you ' ve read them are serious .
this drying all over the world leads to a dramatic increase in fire .
and the disasters around the world have declined in a really extraordinary and unprecedented scale .
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 .
this is a completely unsustainaed pattern development .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it is doing .
in the last five years , we ' ve produced 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours - 25 million tons every day into the oceans .
look closely at the area of the eastern pacific , from the american continent north and both sides of the indian subcontinent , where there ' s a dramatic decline in oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest single factor for global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the equally biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two largest pollers , along with china .
and the proposal was to build many of more coal mines .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that have been eliminated in the last few years with some green alternatives that have been proposed .
however , there ' s a political debate in our country .
and the coal industries and the oil industries have spent quarter of a billion dollars last semester year promoting clean coal , which is inherent , a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something .
around christmas at home in tennessee , ran a billion tons of carbonlb .
you probably to see it in the news .
this is in our country , the second largest waste flow in america .
this happened around christmas .
one of the commercials coal industry around christmas was this one .
frosty the coalman is a fun , happy guy .
it ' s in contain and in abundance in america , and it helps to grow our economy grow .
frosty , the coalman gets cleaner every day .
it ' s affordable and loving , and workers remain in pay and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful mine is the head of massey coal .
let me say one very clearly : al gore , nancy pelosi , harry reid , you don ' t know what you ' re talking about .
so the alliance for climate change alliance has launched two campaigns .
this is one , part of her .
at the coalergy , we see climate change as a serious threat to our business .
so we set it down on the top line of spending a significant amount of money to get an advert way , to get the truth about coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it ' s clean - and it smells good .
so , don ' t worry about climate change .
just leave that to us .
acid coal , you ' ve heard a lot of it .
so let ' s take a tour of this modern , clean coal factory .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it ' s the sound of clean coal technology .
and yet burning coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , the remarkably clean coal technology that you see here is changing everything .
look at it closely , this is today ' s clean carbon technology .
finally , the positive alternative merges with our economic challenge and our of national security challenge .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that connects all of these is our dependence on carbon - based fuels like dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there ' s a brave new solution to get us out of this miserable situation .
rebu america with 100 percent clean electricity in the next 10 years .
a plan to bring america back to work , to make us safer and help stop global warming .
finally , a solution big enough to solve our problems .
rebuive america . find out more .
this is the last one .
it ' s about a reasorgming of america .
one of the fastest ways to reduce our dependence on old , dirty fuel that choffoking our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create well - paid jobs .
rebu america . it ' s time to accept reality .
there ' s an old african proverb : " if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to get far , go together . "
we have to get far , and quick .
thank you .
i want to start by asking you to think about the time of your childhood when you were playing with building blocks .
as they realized how to reach out and access their hands , pick the cl and move the hands , they actually learned to think about and solve problems by understanding and changing spatial context .
spatial thinking is closely related to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist - inspired by the way we interact with real objects - along with my colla advisertor patti and my colleague jeevan kalanithi , i began to wonder : what if we use computers that instead of a mouse pointer that moves like a digital fingertip on a flat inter surface . what if we could intervene with both hands and grab the data physically and arrange it the way we want ? grab data
this question was so poirating that we decided to explore the answer and developed carn mites .
in short , a sible is an interactive computer the size of a cookie .
you can be moved with your hand , you can sense each other , you can sense your movements , and you have a screen and a radio receiver .
more importantly , they are physical , which is why you only move them building blocks by extending your hands and passing .
and the sibles are an example of a new generation of tools for manipulapulation digital data .
and as these tools become more physical and develop a sense of their movements , recognize each other , and per realize the subtleties of our dealing with them , then we can start exploring new and entertaining types of interaction .
i ll start with a few simple examples .
this sible is designeded for the video display , and when i flip it in one direction , the video is played forward ; if i flip it in the other direction , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits sense each other .
so when i put them side - by side , it make you interest .
if you ' re surrounded by , you notice that , and you get a little nervous .
and they also feel their movement and their wrtion .
one interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to see was that we could apply everyday gestures to data , such as wash color the way you do with liquids .
in this case , we haveed three sibles as a paintap paint , and i can use them to pour paint in the in the middle where they mixed together .
if we overaggerate it , we can push back a little bit .
there are also some nice opportunities in education like languages , math , or logic games , where we give people the opportunity to rapid try and want to see the results immediately .
here i am - this is a fibonacci series that i create with a simple equation program .
this is a game of words that ' s a kind of a mixture of scrabble and boggle .
basically , you get every round ofble randomly assigned letter on tricula , and while you ' re trying to make words , they ' re tested by a dictionary .
then after about 30 seconds , you mixed again , and you have a new combination of letters and new possibilities to try .
thank you .
these are some kids who came on to the media lab trip , and i could get them to try it out , and i took a video of it .
they really loved it .
one of interesting things about these kinds of applications is that you don ' t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is " make words , " and they know exactly what to do .
here are a couple of people testing it .
this is our latest beta tester down on the right .
it turned out that he just wanted to stack the chilibles .
so for him , they were just building blocks .
this is an interactive animated application .
we wanted to develop a tool for language learners .
this is anthony . this .
he can bring new characters into the scene bying the botl from the table showing this figure .
here he makes the sun .
the sun rises .
now he puts a tractor into the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by shake the sapbas and putting them side by side , he can let the characters interact .
. invent your own story .
hello !
it ' s a story with open ending , and he can decide how it evolves .
flying cat .
the last example i have time to show today is a music sequencer for live performances that we recently developed act in the sabiabas as sound , like guitar , bass and drum .
each one has four different variations ; you can choose which you want to use .
and you can put those sounds into the sequence that you can rear arrange in any pattern .
and you eat them in by just putting a tone sible to a sequence menuil .
there are effects that you can change live , like noise and filters .
you connect it to a particular tone and then you tend it to plug in .
and then major effects like speed and volume that you apply to the entire sequence .
so let ' s see .
we start by putting the leadership in two sequence tribles and arran putting them in a row , extending them and adding a little bit more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i ' m going to do some drum on this .
and now i connect the filter to the drum so that i can control the effect live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by flipping the pace in one direction or another .
and now i ' m still connect the filter to the bass for a little bit more expression .
i can change the sequence as it happens .
so i don ' t have to plan them in advance , but i can improvise ; extend it or shorten it .
and finally , i can eras off the whole sequence by turning the volumele to the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my excitementm is to develop new human - computer interfaces that fit better with how our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you part of this new design world and some of thesibilities of what we ' re working on in our lab .
the idea i ' d like to leave you with is that we are on the verge of this new generation of adisers to interact with digital media that bring information into our world that matches our demands .
thank you .
i ' m looking forward to talking to all of you .
yeah , good day .
i ' m happy to i ' m there .
yeah , so , what should biohacking ?
i have to get it this with a little bit , and that is biohacking is just looking at modern molecular biology .
i ' m studying molecular biology , and i ' ve been doing this on biohacking for a years now , and i started that because i just wanted to know more deeply and i also wanted to do it myself , what i learned in studies .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to sort of get closer to the matter , like that .
i think molecular biology generally now , generally , biotechnology , everything you belong to it , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now is extremely important , and become much , much more important in the future .
there ' s such controversial things like all these genetically engineered plants on the farms .
there ' s now craig venter in the u . states s . , ' trying to make biofuel , which is gase from algae .
and then , there are things that have are come completely happen everyday life , but most people aren ' t even aware of , like detergent enzymes that allow us to wash at 40 degrees of laundry are also genetically optimized enzymes .
and the list can be on forever .
and so out of the interest in this , in this in this technology , i just went further there .
so what why hack now ?
most people know most people know this from the software sector .
computers hack , and then in the media it , yes , the hackers are breaking somewhere and stealing data and so on .
now this is kind of very sad for the hacker scene , because it doesn ' t really affect what it actually started like that and what ' s actually behind it .
and that was that the software hackers started with computer servers in the ' 70s and that ' s what the internet came .
and it ' s about solve a problem in a playful , creative , imative way .
and problem , this isn ' t just a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can also be just be an access problem , is simplify things , so any problem , raise a question , and how can you do it differently , or how can you do it better ?
and it just it was just been grew up with software , but there ' s also in the electronics sector , there ' s also a whole tinkering scene , that electronics circuits to do all kinds of fake - things .
and now moves towards biology , and i want to take this metaphor , that comes from synthetic biology , that biology is actually an information science , because the d . n . a code is an abstract code , that , yes , it ' s not the same as computers , because it ' s dynamic , because it ' s matter , that ' s real matter , not just cyber . this .
but it ' s also a code , and you can program it , and therefore you can also hack itly , like that , and i found that was incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to go a lot deeper into .
this , actually only taken two thousand eight really shape , these networks .
there ' s hackteria dot org , which is originally from switzerland , which is network with europe and a collaboration in india - based network , but that now has members or active people all over the world .
this is this has a more artistic orientation , so there ' s a lot of artists and philosophers , and ' re working with scientists dealing with these technologies and asking questions and process this creatively , there are museum exhibitions and yes , everything of things .
but it ' s really always about finding such a gent access , such a playful deal with it .
and then there ' s do - it - yourself - bio dot org , d . i . y . bio .
this is a network from the u united states . , which is actually more a kind of a forum where you sit and discuss online .
they ' re a little bit more technical oriented , and a little bit more business out the way , and there they ' re also asked , yes , practical questions being asked .
and from these networks that have made this popular , a scene to emerge that i want to portrait a moment .
here in the image on the top left you see biocurious , which is a hackerspace , which is basically a kind of school , a private school , a nonpro - profit where anyone can go to .
kids , old , all sorts of people go there to just deal with it , they set up a lab and they look at what can you do when these lab protocols go on .
here on the bottom left is a group in indonesia , house of natural fibers , but they ' ve been around for quite a long time .
longer than these other two networks .
they ' re also dealing in such an artistic aspect with biological materials and , yes , electronics computers , and they combine it in a fairly remote way .
a group of ankara that i met a while back ago , who have this is a student group of students that used wanted to convey to the public more about what they ' re learning in college , and they ' ve done little like streets and trying people to explain what d . n . a is .
and i have a lecture a lecture in the gallery in copenhagen in the medical museum in combination with an exhibition on this .
and that is , yes , these are these are mostly quite young people , but the only thing that actually unites what unites them all together is this fascination of technology .
and what you can do with it and also specifically to society and asking , like , okay , what do you know , what do you want to participate with in it , do you have an interested in gettingaging with it ?
so , okay , in to hack biology , you kind need material .
you of course need biological materials , and but you also need tools , and that ' s a laboratory .
or , what you normally understand by a lab are sort of crazy machines , extremely expensive , extremely disconnected , just for professionals , trained academic with ph . d . and so on .
and our approach was just to say , okay , actually you don ' t have to do that .
this ' s actually not necessary , because every coffee machine has actually has high - developed technology than most laboratory devices , which is really the case .
and s o with this premise with this premise , for example , brian degger in england , tried to put a minimal lab , then took a steam cooker , a heating plate and , yes , soup bro , and then worked bacteria , .
so anyone who ' salloes a soup that he ' s standing for too long has done it .
i then tried this in my lab at home expand a little bit lab , and then i kept buying second - hand equipment on ebay and did a little bit of d . n . a analysis , trying to do a fatherhood test , so d . n . a fingerprinting at home .
now this shouldn ' t be a joke , but . down the here of the picture you see the lab , in tape row , so a custom -ed garage with all kinds of laboratory equipment that the university has picked up , a group in paris that ' s doing up something has set up and is pretty successful with it and also doing pretty interesting things , i also want to do a project .
and this is biocurious , the hackerspace mentioned , this one , a kind of school basically for molecular biology .
and yes , you see , it ' s relatively diverseogen , so there ' s a position from people doing this alone at home to large larger organizations who are already doing this more formally in institutionalized form .
but always the idea that it should be simple and accessible .
the first project that we did as an international group , when we became kind of aware of ourselves , ok , we ' re here as a real scene , and we ' re online , and so we know the people who are always chatting there and so on .
and then just came from the do - it - yourself bio org website founders , and said , oka k , we really have to meet now , to meet real , and then organized two events , one in london , two thousand 10 , and shortly after that in the u . s . a , in san francisco .
and , it was also about , yeah , oka , who are we , what do we want , what do we want do we want to say share ?
and what are our values , and what are what is our purpose , our foundation ?
and then we worked up with a code - of conduct .
this was quite intuitive , so everybody just expressed their wishes , his and what keeps them , then .
there was , i think , a very good code came out .
and we have that ' s not obvious , but it ' s , i think , has run met pretty well , and people are quite convinced of it .
and we even tried to bring that back to the academic world , but ' kind of ' t come there .
so i think we from the biohacker scene are actually a step further than the academic world .
yeah , what kind of projects are we actually doing now ?
one project that i did with the hackteria network in switzerland was that we wanted to make what - called optical trap or optical clipper .
this is if you focus a laser beam on you in the room , you can capture little particles in the air or in the liquid and then move in that focus , so , it ' s captured there , so like a tractor .
this really works , this is done in the academic setting , and we thought , oka , we might do that , then took a webcam , thatrewed , sc switched off the lens , turned it around , then you have a microscope that ' s about four hundred times .
this is what you see down there .
and then we screwed a d . v . d . flamer and pulled the flame laser out , and then tried to focus on this camera there .
and unfortunately that it didn ' t work , unfortunately , but we ' ve learned a lot about it .
another project , that which is from the french group there in paris , worked , ' s pretty cool .
and that is that he ' s such a thing , a brainwavemeterr , like e . e . g or something like that , so he ' s been looking at neurobiology , his name is sam neurohack .
he then he built this helmet there , and in partnership with the museum , this has gone .
and then the visitors could go into the room , sit on this chair , sit on this helmet on .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what you thought , or how you thought , different lights went in the room .
it was a pretty fancy project .
another thing from the united states that also just has to do with this fatherhood is the p . c . r , which is the polymer chain reaction , complicated word .
so it ' s about copying genes , multi transrodosing them , which transsing fragments so you can make them visible .
so if i do this , that the profile are doing at the scene , then they go , they collect any hair samples hair , and then they do apply this method , and then they can say , okay , this hair belongs to this person being , like this .
and the machines that do this , they ' re pretty expensive the those things you buy commercially , the cheapest ones go off at four of thousand of dollars .
and it ' s not in the hobby domain , but it ' s a really cool technology that can does do a lot .
so this is just one application of many that you can do with this .
and they ' ve put two builders and said , oka , we ' ll make this easier and cheaper , and then they we made out of open source , which is free hardware , electronics stuff , this device , and they ' ve actually broughtped this to market and they ' re now the cheapest provider of these devices in the world .
i think six hundred dollars or something like that .
but anyway , it ' s still not cheap , but it ' s definit certainly in a framework where it ' s getting becoming much more available .
so i think it ' s a very successful hack .
one project i recently started was build a gene gun .
gene gun is , yes , like air pressure gun that shoots about that far , two centimeters or something .
you put d . n . a on gold particles , and then the gold particles into this air pressure gun , and then i shot them on onion and then i light them like this .
so the device that you see didn ' t work .
but this is my prototype , which looked pretty stu , on a branch like this , the thing on it , put electronics on it and put pressure , and but that was the pressure was too high , the thing broke .
and then i took a cream donor and i plugged it in .
a cream donor , if you make it full of water , it has enough pressure , so i think , about 40 to 60 bar top it .
and so you can accelerate the particles strong enough , and then they go into the onion .
and the commercial device costs about 15 , 000 dollars uphill or something like that , waveanners about 50 .
so it doesn ' t have the same efficiency , but it ' s basically possible .
so and that ' s right now , is that the core issue of the scene is to increasing this availability of technology and also to increase the information and understand that more people can be engaged in it .
because , as said at the beginning , it ' s an extremely important technology , and most people have pretty little idea about it , and they don t have no chance to get really well .
because if you just read about it , from secondary literature , it ' s not the same as if you ' ve done yourself or seen it yourself .
and i think technology is becoming more and more important in our modern societies .
and if you also an informed to able to make meaningful decisions in society and to talk , then you need access to knowledge and to technology .
and you also have to do it and understand it in order to do it and understand it .
and that then operates under the umbrellas open knowledge and citizen science .
so that as citizens , you ' repower to just deal with these scientific technologies .
and that ' s the core concern of biohackers .
these are the people who at least officially registered themselves on the website , d . i . y . bio - dot . org website .
this is s already a pretty remarkable number of people around the world .
and what ' s also interesting is that they ' re also represented in southeast asia .
that ' s what i think there ' re fewer people in there than they actually exist .
so i know about some who haven ' t got in .
and these are just the biohacker , the individual people .
in part , with these hackerspaces , which are put in these places .
and but that ' s at the very beginning .
as i said , two thousand it just started .
and hackerspaces , the computer hackerspaces , because the c - base in berlin was the first , nine hundred - year new .
and this has now become a huge network of very good , yes , infrastructure centers that are represented all over the world .
and we hope , of course , that we spread , and then also equally well connectedted , so that more people can be involved in it .
and i ' d invite to deal with it and also try something yourself myself .
now it ' s not that simple now , but it ' s not impossible if you have enough curiosity and you put enough energy in there , you can get far .
thank you for listening .
that ' s it .
yeah , hello .
how do we humans actually work ?
that ' s a question that really makes me very much as a designer , but also in the field ofbility research and all things in the user experience .
that ' s how you meet people in interactive media so they can use these interactive media and they create a as satisfying experience .
because i believe that the interactive media inside us address archaic cognitive models , paradigms that were been programmed in our biological memory very , very long time ago , and that we can just be - created people through interactive media .
and this is very amazing , because you actually think believe that this high - technology that you ' re encounter is actually bringing you into the future , but in fact , the future is just within us , in our archaic roots .
so what are archaic models ?
i just wrote four words , and i ' like to explain them briefly .
to archaic cognitive models , and that is these are the models that we ' ve acquired in the pre - industrial times .
one of these archaic models is that we have basically natural relationship with virtuality .
that basically sounds unusual at first .
but i ' m going to go into that a moment and i ' m going to prove you that you also have a natural relationship with virtuality .
the second thing is that since because of these archaic models , ' ve been very able to speak very , very visuallly , even though we use a coded language today .
and the third area , which actually explains itself .
we all know that interactive media are nonlinear by definition , in terms includes the denial of linearity , and which of course tells us that we feel linearity as normal today .
the fourth thing is that history us is a place of information broad .
what ' s about the virtuality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world ?
i ' d like to prove that you that .
how many doors do the house that you live in ?
we ' re not going to be to be able to spontaneously answer them to immediately , but it ' s going to going to happen and ' s happening right now .
they go in the mind through this house that they live in , and look at how many doors there are .
and that ' s what they do .
they virtualize reality without computers .
fantastic , isn ' t it ?
and , is , where ' re str trying , imagine example at media campus , virtual reality in our v . r . lab , and we can actually do it all the time .
and this ability to virtualize virtualize reality , which people had mise in the industrial , because they didn ' t had nothing at .
they didn ' t have books .
or they didn ' t have photocopy .
they didn ' t have mass media .
the only thing they had was their head .
and in that head , the memory went on .
in this head , knowledge was recalled , and using these virtual images , imagination , knowledge has also been passed .
and that ' s why it ' s also so embedded in us that we can deal with virtuality so well .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can take a little trip .
yes , that can done .
the interesting thing about this is that at that time , the human was simultaneously a media producer and medium himself .
now , if you think thinking a little .
what are media today ?
then you ' ll notice that there has been a change .
but that ' s ll i ' ll talk about that in a minute .
the key tool of information processing has always been stories ever forever .
shamans , priests , so - called knowledge guards , were also relegated to keeping knowledge in stories .
and even today , we ' re still very , very heavily on stories .
to the author of the book , " the storytelling animal , jonathan gottschfeld , we still spend a thousand hundred hours a year reciting stories .
that means for a child who has spent until the age has most of his life receptioning stories .
now we think our love of stories depends on we as a child , on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far missing .
this goes a lot further back to the pre - industrial cultures .
but for me , in the interactive media , what ' s particularly amazing is that we have been naturally embedded in our biological memory , the ability to think nonlinearly .
i brought you an example from the nootaka indian tribe .
and their they lives lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very island - like area , and you had to kind of navigate there , get from island to island to get food .
and they did this with what we call lead maps .
you may know that if you ' re a little bit about that from the australian aboriginal americans .
they have similar principles .
they didn ' t have lead maps , but they ' used the so genful songlines , or dream pathss .
and what ' s interesting thing about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be depicted through songs .
where language was assigned of their lower status .
that is you navigated through sound and over rhythm .
and these sounds and that rhythms have represented the geology , the topography of a region , and that , of course , also allowed you to disse fragment these songs and compmble differently , and move back to left , to right and also move back to the destination .
but why don ' t we sing anymore to get from a to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what actually happened ?
what this is , this is the so genent machine age .
we ve moved in what we call the bf age .
what is the machine age , and the book , and happened this is photocopy .
and that ' s exactly what happened that we have shifted the responsibility for our memories and the production of our individual memories to external media .
the book and on the picture .
so unfortunately , we ve learned god ' s to virtualize a .
virtuality has suddenly become alien to alien to us and has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous known design researcher at carnegie university , has gone so far to say that these mass media , he means the book and the image , not the television , the internet etc so . and so on , what we call mass media today , that these mass media have fossilpedized our memories and eruplod our ability to virtualize .
let ' s do a little back balance .
from the vo age to machine age .
what does affect our minds our thinking and on our memory ?
then the fading influence of pre - industrial cultures .
and they ' have been more and more overdue over the centuries by the effects of the machine age .
that is that instead of remiing individually , we have standardized , widely spread , mass - distributed patterns of memories that we can connect to our personal memories to .
we no longer producing ourselves .
we have an abstract language .
we no longer think it no in pictures , things in pictures , we encode our language .
we ' ve become used to things happen linearly .
and we ' ve accepted linearity as a law , and there are only exceptions , like non - linearity .
what we have left is storytelling .
, we ' re still very , very heavily arrested involved as storytelling processing .
the question is , what ' s next ?
we had the shigt age , we had the machine age , and we ' re now entering what we called the cyber age .
this sounds very fun , and it sounds very much like science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of the cyber age that bring us back these possi back to redcover our capabilities .
it ' s about virtuality , it ' s about non - linearity , it ' s about storytelling .
i want to explain that a little bit for a second .
there are technical concepts like augmented reality , which is augmented reality .
so if you look at google glasses , for example , this is a concept that let us rec combine the virtual world with the real world , which is our affinity for virtualization , to feel feeling the virtual as something normal , natural is addressed again .
another example is what ' s called virtual reality . as crazy as may sound in the context of my talk , we move physically in non existing virtual worlds like model the holoth .
and other another example is ambient , intelligent systems .
these are spaces that can respond intelligently to a human being .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
i finished graduated , and i hope the video works , with a very , very beautiful project , which is the graduate work of michael burk , ann - kathrin krenz , joris kris and jan - moritz muller .
and the two are here today .
maybe you can get up for a second so you can talk to the two about the project .
and i brought this project as an example of how again , read again in these archaic cognitive models .
it whole is a game , i have to say about this .
which of course extremely opposite to storytelling , and it ' s a computer game .
and when i say computer games , you ' re probably have in mind that any people are cheapng in front of any console , or that they ' re playing with them with some console in their hand .
anyway , they do that inside .
this is a outside game .
and this is specifically meant for to discovering the outside world , so that i rec rediscover the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , the data , and the data space that we ' make produce to the real world .
i apologize i have to cut so much .
and you can explain that a lot better , there ' s more a lot more to it .
and that is that it ' s about discover a city by looking at where places have been positive or negatively split in .
and so i get a very different view of the city , a very different impression , which is i see negative and positive zones of a city , and i get a very different virtual map of a very real city .
and now we can like to look at that .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little explanation of what you ' re going to see in a moment .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , ' s clear .
and with a kind of flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
so , i ' d like to summarize up my talk , which is in the sense that the properties and the skills that we ' ve gained from the grid age that have gone so a little bit ago in the machine age , that can be - activatedted with using what we call called the cyber age , and that in this way , through complex , technological , new products , the future , but we actually come back to our roots . come
thank you .
yes , i ' m verycite happy to be able to be with you .
i just been asked whether this bag is a talking bag , and instead speak to me .
he ' s not going to do that .
i ' m also going to resolve what ' s inside of there .
but so far i ' m ve only not doing it a little bit curious yet .
yes , kids are naturally curious , or should be curious , designers too .
i ' m an home designer , so , of course , i ' m also dealing with the of curiosity , and how does curiosity changes our thinking , and why do we lose curiosity and need to - it and so and so on .
this is a whole range of things that you ' re dealing with alongside actual existence as an designer .
when professors become curious , they ' re often pushed into such research sessionss .
and that ' s also what i ' ve had in last half a year .
a research chair on natural user interface design .
now you ' re going to wondering , why do all these designers begin to deal with such natural , archaic sources forms of communication , interaction and so on ?
and i ' m just holding one of these little devices , because things are supposed to get more intuitive , more natural , more userable , and you have to look at , what is actually natural for us humans , which is userable or intuitive .
and in the background , i been in natural user interface design , is the next generation in human computer , where i ' s in the relationship of human computer how our tools , or how the computer changes from the computer exact to the digital assistant .
so i ' ve been looking at when is something natural or intuitive .
maybe you might have to take a look at that .
why is this actually happening ?
so if we look at the evolution of our society , shown here in briefly , we now move from the third to the fourth generation of society or form of society .
so from modernsm to the computer society .
every society is shaped by a primary medium .
at the beginning , the tribal society through language .
that is , you ' ve found yourself by speaking a common language , you could communicate with each other , you moved into the same cave , or other areas , created cities or villages , and you ' ve created a tribal society .
but the primary medium was language , something very natural , something very living .
now you also had to learn , so no child can talk from naturally , but we learn it organicaly and relatively naturally .
this that was then replaced by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a huge scream at the time , because of course you the living language started in the form of writing , which is what that is fluid and living , i start and mani scratch it in stone , and i manipulate it .
depending on how i sh and when i wee , of course , it ' s a very different narrative than if there ' s a living , kind of itself .
but sucs then just took this type as a primary medium , got entry .
then came the next generation that we actually live in primarily in today .
this is the print and print script with guth and others .
at the time , it was just a confrontation where aristocracs , clks and others said , if you actually insane when people start reading , then people want to talk , and of ' s , that ' s totally fatal .
and now we come into the next generation , and the exciting thing is that , a generation change is only every few hundred years , and we ' re really in this in this phenomenal phase that we ' re in this .
of course , this confus , because we see on the one hand we the new media , socil social media , facebook and so on .
with total transparency of , which what is the new thinking , what hitting old thinking , doesn ' t saying that lasagna is horse meat and beef or other phenomena , because i just want to misses that out and i want to do that it that .
and these two worlds are collapse , thinking new and old thinking .
the exciting thing about this is , if you look at this , this new society , this computer society , draws a lot of mechanisms , principles and archaic paradigm from tribal society .
but now not at the local level , but at the global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that ecology is a global issue .
not , if i think locally ecologically here , and the neighbor thinks less ecologically , the it whole doesn ' t work anymore .
that is , the local village has actually become a global village with the same principles , as naturally course , as intuitive , but also total transparency .
just as you knew in the village back , who has something with whom and when , what ' s happening about this extension of ourelves through these mobile end devices at a global scale .
whether it ' s that we learn knowledge globally and acclati faster and faster and better .
as it used to happen veryly in the village .
so in the background , i was just looking at looking at , what does it mean , what is natural for us , what we have learned , but what is instinctively to us , so what makes the difference ?
because a lot times people come , they can ' t make it use friendly so anyone can deal with it .
so you have to deal with , which that means , and not just change it , that it ' s different , but it should wants to get better .
and when , is , it ' s a little intuitive , and how can i as an designer , influencepower and make things to become a user - friendly , so re as intuitive , because then they ' re fun and they ' re easy to use ?
then you ' re concerned , even during college , in at the of perception and perptual psychology .
and this , of course , is something where you start and look and say , okay , now i ' m just going to look into inside the inner self .
and what does it actually inside of it ?
so how do we work when we look in there ?
and what does mean , of course , intuitively , and how do our channels of perception , and how does cognitive processing work ?
because steve jobs once said , you need to dig deeper to understand how it works .
so you really have to look in detail when i want to make something userable or intuitively manageable , which is that at the heart .
and you can see that is that you a our seven senses , most people think we have only got five , and it ' s even already seven , and there ' s certainly the next sense , eight sense in near , and as an extension , ourselves again .
and look at , how do we process information , how do we collect information ?
just saying , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
a lot of people use the word , but they don ' t even know what it means in detail .
but i have to understand at the heart , in nature , when does information becomes information , when does data becomes information and from information , so i know how to make things as intuitive or of course manageable .
and of course , how does design affect perception ?
we see this when i design things , i can make them confusing like on the right side , where i don ' t know what ' s salt and pepper , or i can sort of intuitively them by showing things .
so a lot more natural , in a vessel , but i kind of see right where there is s salt and pepper in there .
and when i tell someone , give me salt or pepper , then on the right , they ' ll think about , where ' s in there .
and on the just intuitively access the left and hopefully realize that there ' s no sugar in there , just giving the salt accordingly .
but also our perception itself , how does it fooling us .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the small circle , even although that ' s not the case at all , but they ' re very the same size , and yet our perception changes depending on what context we put things in .
does anybody know what that is ?
come on .
pattern recognition should still work .
it ' it ' s more of my glasses .
so it ' s a circle .
a second circle is already beginning to correlate or associate some certain similarity .
and then if i put a another half -cle in , of suddenly sudden we don ' t see just one unit , which is circle , circle and , but we see one unit , we don ' t see three parts , one circle , one circle , another one .
this is called the shape law , or shape psychology , which actually affects us in perception .
what ' s important for the designers , who have this in the first semester , the great design laws .
shape law of closeness , shape law of continuity and so on .
often in third , they forget forgotten .
but that ' s an essentially important part , if you just want to make things as intuitive possible .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is that of vision .
now once it sounds pretty trivial , but it ' s very exciting when you get into it .
so we have eyes in front , and now you think , we ' re looking from the back to the back .
that ' s wrong .
you first you see looking from the back to the forward .
that they project an assumption forward that they see something they recognize , example of circles .
that is , we project our vision before we see it , bring it back into our visualing devicearat to say , okay .
i have a cognitive feedback , you ' projected something you want to see .
that ' s there , that comes back .
then it goes back forward , because the back doesn ' t trust at the front and says , now please really look and sure see if what you see is also what you want to see .
and then it goes back , and then it ' s actually seen .
so a very , very exciting process of how certain things happen and what milliseconds these things happen .
i don ' t know who of you know this picture .
there ' s exactly the same thing i just described .
now everyone from this pattern is trying to see something .
i don ' t know who recognizes something .
does anybody see something particular ?
a dalai lama , right .
once i ve seen that there ' there ' s a dalai lama in there , you know .
you ' ll never forget it , because i ' ll show you where the dalai lama is .
now you see the dalai lama .
and then on , now you always see it .
that is , i ' ve actually spoilled them so in the fact that they don ' t recognize a pattern of dadrinmore , but i ' conditioned in a very short amount of time to see this dog again in this hilre picture .
and this is this projection of vision , feedback , vision .
now i know it , and now i ' m projecting forward that i see the dalai lama .
i see the dalai lama .
so very , very exciting processes that then happens actually way in this , yes , gray ' s not , but it ' s like in this pink mass .
does anybody know what three seconds is ?
long , yes .
this is our present .
so , it ' s also always interesting to know as a designer .
if i know something takes three seconds to sort of shift from the present into past , i can also cross very well wait by employing it by always employing somebody to three seconds .
he has to process that as a present .
then it goes into the past , so i can bridge very elegantly wait , for example , at the computer , if i know this phenomenon .
what takes five and a half milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time when you fall in love .
that means watch , if you know that now , look at who you ' re at it how long , because i don ' t give a chance of what can happen in exactly way .
and fifteen milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the period of most perceptions we have .
that is , this first impression happens at a fast speed that we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we re attention to and how we sort of protect from our environment , so we can think that accordingly about that .
of course , designers are not just concerned with subject perceptions and neural processing , or cognitive economics , but primarily of , the issue of the human - to - object relationship .
so how does a human deal with certain things accordingly ?
there ' s productiveically the practical functions , so such formal aspects or formal logic aspects .
there are sign functions where i know exactly where i actually have to reach .
but there are also symbolic functions , why does someone have for a small pocket where hardly fit anything in thereway , out such horrende amounts of money , even though it ' s not that practical ?
we ' re more on the symbolic , at the level , that we ' re dealing with , as designers , .
back to my actual subject of natural user interface , and the topic that of course , behind it , is usability .
accessbility always means how can i achieve a certain goal quickly , or how can a user in a certain context of use achieve as effective , efficient and satisfying achieve a goal .
that ' s it ' s more the norm it .
how can i make something as use ?
can i use this directly , or i need a manual , or i need a training to do it .
and less usable or use - friendly it is .
that i just make this it differently and make it beautiful doesn ' t mean it ' s better manageable .
you also have to understand that too .
and then if you look at the software that we just saw , you ' ll also understand why ninety - nine percent of our software is not intuitive or not up , including the i - pad in many areas or i - phone , although it ' s much more intuitive than classic software .
and intuitive use has not only since apple a fundamental economic factor of apple , called a fundamental success factor , if i want to make technological devices available to humans .
why ? why
because usually through this new kind of use , which is the natural user interfaces , we ' re five times faster on average at our goal .
you have to imagine that if you make some of the classic soft software , it takes five hours and only with this new kind of natural software an hour .
that doesn ' t mean you can probably go home for four hours , but your employer or anyone will noticed out how to treat you with the four hours accordingly .
but i want to say that , of course , for us , it ' s a increase in capability to do certain things well .
and then we go back into the realm of software , here are the first command line interfaces , which were very abstract , where it took us months to deal with these systems .
then the next ones who have ve already been working with on a neural model or mental model like the software eergonic , which is that you had an idea of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop , to make the computer use .
so not more zeros and ones or cryptic code , but a metaphor .
that made it much more useable , but of course it ' s much better .
the next generation of graphics is already working a lot more with behavior .
so that ' s where i as an architect , i design behavior more than looking .
this is also a paradigm shift .
that all suddenly of i ' ve decide that looks becomes more and insignificant to success , just the usability is an application .
and if i take a step further into these natural user interfaces , where i have to control by voice , by language , by touch , by gesture and no mouse and cursor things , i ' m even faster and even more immediate .
but that also brings me to the point , when do things become more intuitive ?
if you get more intuitive , then i have to brush , of my little friend here and look see , what does that mean from cognitive economics , when is something really something intuitive ?
and that is always a little intuitive to us if i have to think little about it as little much .
so apparently he doesn ' t like to think , but he make it relatively easy .
the less i think about it a way , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for the designer ?
that is , if we look at that we can trans transfer existing models of behavior action from one to something else , like the metaphor , then i can take advantage that as a designer .
that is , i can just actually transfer an intuitive human action model to a software and make the software much more useable .
of course , the question is , what is actually the most intuitive param of human beings , and now i ' ve tolded you it ?
this is what ' s called osit model .
this is what each of us uses , and osit is an acronym and stands for orientation , selection , inform , transpula .
is each of you doing this all the time , but he s it unconsciously and sort of intuitive or partly instinctive .
the model is already all in the womb , and it ' s cross - cultural , so it works worldwide at young and old , and it ' s used by us all the time , without most people us knew that this model is there .
osit osit itself becomes about 50 to 70 thousand times of us each per activity , so in sleep you ' ve discovered that then it ' s less often than the day .
i can now just direct this mental model of action , select , inform , translate to an interaction system .
and through this kind of transmission , much of like with the metaphor of the desktop , now is not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a pattern of action , a action principle of .
and that ' s on a higher grail of user than transfer of a classic metaphor , which is the desktop .
and if i translate this , for example , in where i interpret as control , seleng as a choice , inform in the case , it ' s big to me , i can look at it in the detail , and yes , trans means , i can also throw it somewhere or send somebody or shopping and so on .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
i ' m going to try this through an example .
everybody ' s eaten cake .
control : now i ' m kind of interacting with the object , can zoom out , zoom in .
i get the whole picture , and i can now filter into this , and i can say , just show me all the things chocolate , for example .
and i suddenly have an interface that which is much more intuitive and much more natural .
because i can touch things like the pieces , and they come up to me is much more natural than if those , through hierarchical organized websites or other mechanisms make these things available .
imagination is more important than knowledge , and with that phrase , i ' d also like to close giving a and again that designers need to think differently to come up with new solutions , and in that sense , i thank you very much for their attention and please .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first thing when you grow up big as a child , as a baby , is that you care about what choices you have , right ? and depending whether your parents have allowed you to play more less in the pot in , the more , of course , of course your curiosity , of course gets triggered in .
and curiosity is not learned .
that ' s why everybody who ' s here and are curious are actually people who have a property that you can ' t learn .
i ' m talking about is implement doing basically all this environmental discussion , world change , 40 years of club - of - rome , in quality .
and there ' s a central point about this .
and it ' s to phosphorus .
give pee a chance .
every day they give - they give you about two grams of phosphorus , and every day they have to absb two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise you can ' t have teeth .
they can ' t store energy .
they can ' t have bones .
we could only glide through the oceans as amormorphus waves .
if fact , we don ' t absb any phosp and releaset phosphorus .
amazingly , that we ' re looking at something that was actually natural , but ' s not that .
because everybody is talking about energy , but nobody ' is talking about the phosphorus problem .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have phosp for two years , and , because the of phosphorus mining is , brought a lot more uranium is being put into the environment than it is used in all nuclear plants .
in the last 20 years alone , 15 000 thousand tons of uranium been distributed in our fields in germany .
and we take it all .
it causes leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we ' re a little less harmful .
so , for example , protect the environment , drive less car .
protect the environment , make less waste .
protect the environment , use less energy .
but that ' s not protection .
it ' s like saying , protect your child , just beat it three times instead of five times .
that ' s just a little less destruction .
if we think from grry to hammuld , all of our earth soon becomes a grave or later .
that ' s thinking about weigh to weigh .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as the first thing .
, over 60 percent of the carbon is stored in the ground .
right now , we ' re growing corn and losing between 11 and 30 kilo pounds of tons per hectare , or calculuing to the square meter .
that is , we re losing about five thousand times more in the ground than we ' re formed .
of course , we can look at the waste problem .
and everything is packaging or content .
in example , openbach example , waste , 20 percent of the wastebage is now napkin .
and as we get older , the nappies get bigger .
that ' s they ' re sort of all in the fore phase .
yeah ? .
a baby needs about six thousand nappies .
of course , we could reduce that by 10 percent , of course , but what does that do ?
this is balanced in china in a second .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we deal with these nappies ?
here ' s one the evidence , by the way , that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because phosphorus is de releasedtted through the solid components of the in pigs .
people over the urine .
yeah .
so men can ' t be pigs .
because that ' s evidence for that , isn right it ?
traditionally , we think in the environmental debate , we ' re too many in the world .
and if you give the people , if you tell people to exist , if you say that was better , you weren ' t there at all , they become ambitious and hostile .
and so someone like al gore , one of our great heroes , says there ' s nothing more important than moderni stabilizing the human population .
in israel , if you save a human life , you save the earth .
here it says , the more you kill , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of ants on earth , the ants weigh about four times more than we humans .
i could also take termites , but in the united states , no one nobody likes termites that far , even though they ' re vegetarian .
that is , the ants weigh a lot more than we do .
and because they work much harder than we do and because they only live three to six months , they equal in their weight , a about 30 billion people in energy consumption .
that means we ' re not too many , we ' re too stupid , right ?
and where you can see how far we are from that , what we really wanted to do and could , and how sad we are that we ' re even on earth , you can see that , for example , openbach has a program to 20 40 , you want to be climate neutral here , right ?
they can only be climate - neutral if they don ' t exist , right ?
the only chance .
have you ever seen a climate - neutral tree ?
yeah ? .
one ?
that means all our intelligence means that we want to be stupid than trees , right ?
yeah ? .
no tree is carbon - neutral .
fortunately , not , yes ?
there is no overpopulation problem trees .
there are still six hundred billion trees in the amazon alone .
have you ever heard about overpopulation problems trees ?
that means all of our intelligence means that we want to be stupid than trees .
and where you see , even something like demeter , the most rig bio - ja agriculture , doesn ' t allow our own metabolbolic products to go back .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really needed to go back into .
and we ' re too many with that .
just over that .
that means , we feel so guilty about the earth that we say there ' s no bio - farming , no biologist , no nature et . pro , and as they all say that allow our own ex - artifacts to go back .
isn ' t that sad ?
we ' re too many with .
it ' s certainly useful to be less harmful than in oil use .
but where are we useful ?
we ' re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it ' s about having a big footprint that ' s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the highest is not to be there , right ?
zero emissions , yes ?
you can only have zero emissions if you ' re not there .
even if they were shoot now , they would have emissions .
so you can ' t solve that at all .
we can do it differently .
we can regain our nutrients .
we do in brazil in the where we reclaim the nutrients .
directly , we can get nutrien back in agriculture in this way .
we do this in china , in example , where we take the waste from it directly .
in china , a night pot today is still called honey pots , kind of , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid to bring our nutrients back .
that is , the whole western civilization - history is characterized by the fact that the city always took , but never gave back to the farmers .
and so cities had to grow and more , because the farmers went to the cities , and the cities had to get keep their nutrients further .
that ' s why all the western empires have always expanded , until they didn ' t done infrastructure anymore , and then they imped .
yeah ? .
in china , it was different .
you ' ve done completeless civilization over five thousand years , because you ' ve always been able to bring the nutrients back .
even today , when you ' re invited to dinner in china , expected to stay until they go to the toilet .
because it ' s unfit to walk and take the nutrients .
they ' ve invited they invited for dinner , not for nutrient storage .
that is , you can see on the internet how to reclaim the nutrients .
the beauty of this is , if you do that , what you do agriculture , you make biogas , on a hectare of land of five thousand people in favelas , a farmer can generate about a thousand a thousand dollars , and wait the plant to grow chickens and pigs and ducks and vegetables and fish .
and the great thing about this is that the crime rate in the favelas is down over nine percent .
so we don ' t have to control people being as little bad as .
we can support them be good .
this is , of course , high - tech agriculture , but the plants carry themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they ' re designed by the design that a farmer can just run manage them .
that is , that ' s where crime rates go back .
and none of these facilities , we ' ve been built over 100 - meter in the last 20 years , none of these facilities have ever been beaten .
you could easily throw a liter of olive oil in easily , and then the plant would be ruined over years .
it doesn ' t happen . it
that means we don ' t have to control people being as little bad as .
we can support them be good .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
and by the way , if you want to do something from about this , write down , in germany , the best suite of all seitation is this in rotterdam .
unfortunately , they ' re not in openbach , but maybe they can help the amsterdam a little bit doing .
because the rotterdam plant was best to regain phosphorus .
and he has to go back .
we see in phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it done .
we ' ve now deployed over three years in holland netherlands .
the dutch government has declared that they will be the first country in the world to rec extract phosphorus back .
but we need that in general .
you know , there are two countries that control almost eight percent of the world s phosphorus reserves .
there ' s opec a bunch of orphanages .
these are six and a half countries that control 40 percent of the oil resources .
and we will be able to replace the oil with other energy sources .
but you won ' t be able to replace the phosphorus .
it ' s not about making the existing thing a little less bad , it ' s about doing something right .
and ' s particularly first all asking what is the right thing .
that means it ' s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , of course , you feel it easier to understand , because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yeah ? .
imagine , if , for example , your wife is sad , if you ' ve them , and you come with 50 flowers .
completely inefficient .
but pretty effective , right ?
or take a lip paint .
a woman in germany eats about six per three kilograms during her lifetime .
too there .
this ' s not exactly correct science , because we don ' t know how much stuff scar away .
but a lip paint , even in this lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but absolutely effective , right ?
anything that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
that ' s not resource efficiency , that ' s about efficiency .
to ask , what ' s the right thing ?
not to burning the clean tube a little bit better andposit it with and lose in the internal combustion plant all the materials for cycles , but first of time ask , how do you close cycles ?
imagine mozart efficiently .
yeah ? .
when i invite them in for dinner and i say , yes , there ' s a pill with openhand flavor and a glass of water on it .
wonderful , ' right ?
that ' s efficient .
everything that ' s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
yeah ? .
that is , everything that counts in life is not about saving , avoiding , reducing .
the whole environmental debate .
we tell people , oh , you don ' t have an environmental awareness in the south .
no , throw away is exactly the right thing , right ?
every place you throw away , from , yes , you create life again .
but the wrong things .
if you throw away the wrong things , you have a waste problem .
in how we think from the north .
there ' s every footprint is disadvaged .
when you walk , yes , every footprint destroys the ground .
because the soil is , the mosses will die , and the wind and the water wash away the soil .
but if you ' re in italy , every footprint means that the water stay in the meadow longer .
so , it ' s about creating a huge footprint that becomes a wetland .
not guilt management .
we say sustainability in germany .
yeah ? .
but when i ask you her , how about with your wife ?
then what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , thank pity , right ?
that ' s just the minimum .
so don ' t save , avoid , avoid .
every waste is nutrient .
and it ' s a pleasure when you see in italy people in the high bow bars throwing a coke can out of the car , .
because , you know , this ' s a funny thing .
it ' s a form of territory behavior , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please go .
for example , we example developed an ice cream packaging , which is s at room temperature , liquid .
you can throw them away where they go and stand .
in two hours , it builds everywhere .
and it contains seeds from rare plants , so that they re throw away to biodiversity .
that means we ' re useful , not less harmful about it .
so there are two cycles .
it ' s all supposed to be compostable , of course .
a television or a washing machine , they just use them , they don ' t use them .
just the things that wear away , like shoes , like brakebelts , like car bikes , they have to be to they go into biological systems .
the things that are being used go into technical systems .
but today we ' re just talking about biological systems .
yeah ? .
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
very direct advertising , not for the company madagascar per se , but for you now helping this company make these products successful .
because we don ' t no t longer making things free of .
yeah ? .
so , if i invite you to dinner and say , this ' s free of clons , it doesn ' t help you at all .
no , we ' re going to figure out what ' s inside of it .
positive .
so not like detox .
non not toxic acids .
but everything that ' s inside it is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can put the taxivali type on the pedestrian , and the rubber can go into biological cycles , right ?
all of this is compble from .
and of course if we do , of course , we ' ll do it for adidas , for nike , for cows and mu and the whole textile industry .
and that ' s half of all the waste problems in the world that are caused by the textile industry .
that ' s why you re help with , ask people .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
because they ' ve changed the chairman twice .
and i ' m not so sure they really stay there .
so , help me a little bit .
but it can goes . but .
yeah .
this what has just been presented .
that can it .
we can now make things so that if they wear , if they break , they can go into biological cycles .
technical cycles are the same way .
there ' s a direct last system for this .
this is s is the first ecological backpack , in fact , ' designed to go back into the circulation .
again that , so in every store you can get things back .
if you get there that , right ?
do you remember the napkin again ?
if right now that ' s garbage .
allwhere there these nappies are around , almost .
in the countries where people are getting to money .
up there on the landfills , but elsewhere in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastic , so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water storage , inside , that they can just go back cellulosulose based , then they can plant in israel or hundreds and a half trees with a or tunisia .
yeah ? .
just if you take these nappies , you shri it , sterileze it and take the powder to plant trees .
so the baby is carbon precursor for all of life , from the very beginning .
so , we don ' t need to be climate - neutral , we can be climate sensitive .
it ' s kind of a beneal poop print .
yeah , sort of .
yeah ? .
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything .
i started up an institute like this .
now a lot of people are working there , and they can all be engaged .
there ' s extra a club to this , cradle to cradle club , where anyone can participate in .
so no longer save , avoid , avoid , reduce , not debt management , but smart waste .
does you curious ?
thank you .
the work of the interpreter .
music as a language . music
in the description of my talk , it says that as an interprete , i understand myself as a translator , so in english .
performers are translators of written notes into sound music .
that as a translator , don ' t just translate word after word text into another language , but also understand the deeper meaning of words andrela in so that it make a meaningful translation , anyone who has with foreign languages .
already translated translation from german into english can require more knowledge , even when it you when it ' comes to poetry or to poetry .
but ' foreign to amateurs what we musicians do with our language of .
as an interpreti of a piece of music , i first the written notes .
you ' re probably think that the composer wrote exactly everything he thought of .
in fact , the notes are very vague and imped .
these notes are about as exact or abl as a verbal , although very seemingly accurate , description of a landscape .
because in this verbal landscape description , the smell of the flowers is not smell , to recognize the degree of green , not hear the scing of the wind .
that is , the interpreter has to translate these unawed statements of notes language into another , which is audible , concrete , nonverbal music .
today i want to translate you what i otherwise translate musically , so interpret into a verbal language .
so basically a translation of translation . so
so i pre pretefer to do it thing in german , because if i had to translate it into english , it would be equivalent to me with translation of translation .
so this , the music works me much like the spoken language .
the note notes have the function of the letters of a scriptface .
so it ' s not enough to just learn to read notes and press the keys on the piano or the right place on a violin string .
because these were just the letters that they learned to paint .
the of letters is only when you can addlate language to .
so for the learning process of music , need music language at least as much long as spoken language .
now there are also distinction , whether you learn it for home use , just passively understand , or you can actively speak , to the musical native speaker .
the interprete ' s work starts similar to a theater director .
after once you first choose a piece to play because you ' re excited about it , you start looking the background of the creation of the composition .
you collect information about the play in the secondary literature .
you read in the letters , in the journals , in the notes , or whether there are words , thoughts by the composer themselves .
you study the works he composed before and after .
you make comparisons .
the reasons of writing it .
how and what did he feel ?
what were his circumstances , like society and politics ?
i ' s care interests me all this .
you think into that time by , example looking at contemporary images , or reading literature .
but over time , as anr , have a rich knowledge about the composer that you often play , and it ' s harder and easier for you to think and feel it .
the composer becomes more the friend you live with .
his goal of writing the piece becomes more and more of my personal concern of playing it .
now since the notes are not a precise record of cause of the composer ' s cause , but just a framework , i applying this framework to rev fillill it with meaning and meaning .
i then say , in my own words , what might be written between this framework .
i play explaining what these notes might mean .
now for me and for the composer then , and what they could mean for him today .
every tone , every phrase makes a sense , because i feel it myself , because it comes from my now personal lived .
it has to be consistent in the here and now , otherwise i can ' t convince my audience that ' s my cause .
it ' s a very happy concert if i ' m to have the experience , the piece that i ' ve developed for as long in advance as i re - experi experience .
how to -peri experience a happy new day over and over again , even though with the same rituals of life , getting up , breakfast , going to work , i ex experience the same piece over and over again .
i got back a day again , changing seasons , my pulse slow down at night than in the morning , in a concert hall it takes longer for the sound to come back than comes at home .
i sense the audience breath , consciously or unconsciously .
all of this affects me , and all of this also affects my experience of composition .
what ' s what wonderful is when i ' m standing the stage with a duo partner , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , motivated conversation .
you put a new idea in , and immediately it ' s answered with a reaction .
it ' s exciting , because then things that we haven ' t practiced so this way , and what you can ' t test .
it ' s a lot of fun to make music in this way , and then you as the audience have experienced how the music communicate alive .
so every concert is a different concert .
i will never play the way i did right this moment .
i can ' t play the as i was in 20 years .
i ' m going to have more life experience than i today , so i ' m going to have many more colorlines of , emotions and feelings music than i have today .
i ' m , i ' ll throw some paintbrus , but get new ones it .
i have a nice concrete example of this .
it was on a piano course for music students with my beloved old teacher , professor jurgen ude , a famous beethoven specialist , concert pianist and long - term professor of the music school here in stugar .
unfortunately , i was much too young , so he was already retired when i finally started studying .
but i was very lucky to meet him very early on , when at 13 years old , and so i was on his classes when was high .
i was 17 the time when i went back again in one of his courses , and i played the last of the four ballads of chopin , a romance .
he asked me what the introduction of this ballad was for me .
that ' s such a wear part .
and in my youth , i said , expectation .
and he smgarled up and said , well ?
that has to be the difference of age .
because for me , it means memory .
he was over 60 .
well , at seven , you just have dreams , but you don ' t have significant memories .
i play the piece again every few years , and it ' s changed for me , even though not a single note has changed .
every time it ' s exciting , because over and over again i reading out something new .
an example of this from a very different area . monet painted the sea lion .
it ' s always the same garden , but it ' s at different times , with different lights .
he trans translated the sea lions different as he saw them , as they looked at him at that moment .
his personal impressions of sea lions .
the x - mali interpretation of a piece is comparable to this .
now i ' m also older than chopin at two and a half years when he wrote the piece .
he ' s only lived for nine and a half years .
and i ' m important to look back into the notes , even though i think that i can memorizeorize them .
to keep reci , directly with the composer .
because the notes are the only connection directly to him .
especially when he ' s already died .
now , how do you start speak the language of music ?
i said , it takes about as long as spoken language .
so often , the music education is , you learn to read the notes first .
you ' re basically learn learning to read first before you just speak one word .
you learn to find the notes to the notes on the instrument .
then all the fingers move in time and really as it ' s in the notes , then they sounds that sound together like music .
when that happens error free , the student gets up the next piece .
interpretation is hardly about in the beginning course .
well all , there ' s the in the front the line , which is a quick piece .
lento , slow .
loud and quiet , f and b , etc .
what most of you know here .
but even when you implement these data , there ' s still something technical .
and it ' s still not an interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget something very elemental .
that is that in order to make music on the instrument , your musical activity and feeling should be exist there before .
that ' s singing .
a child who didn ' t learned to singing sing because parents didn ' t prepare it , will won not ' t do it by himself themselves either .
it ' s like talking .
it ' s necessary to have your own experiences and idea of music , and then get it through another possibility , which is through an instrument , sound .
so people who have never singing have never felt directly felt with their body what it is like to make a sound .
create a phrase with his your own breath .
because the musical instrument is the extension of our body .
our vocal chords to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the hammerhead in the piano are the sequel of my fingers .
the melody comes from the gesu and the rhythm comes from the dance .
the continua congraement today with music is not enerating .
you don ' t need to make music any yourselfmore if you get bored .
no longer needed to whistle or sing a song .
every music is flipped away down if you ' re constantly turning on with music from the outside .
i ' , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do if i can ' t sing ?
the i ask , can ' t you sing , a , because you think you can ' t sing ?
or b , because you didn ' t learned how to sing ?
both of them isn ' not too late to start starting to see out if they can ' t do , or to learn how to use these little muscles that tunet the vocal cords .
because you can train that .
or c , because they ' re been told that they ' re inadequate .
so i ask , how professionally competent was this diagnosis ?
have you got a second sense or third signal , as you say today ?
or d , you don ' t like music , so you don ' t want to have anything to do with it .
but what i would regret , because music is a beautiful communicative thing .
but maybe you can figure them .
well , you see , all cases , no one has to be a prospectless candidate .
but please don ' t say , i don ' t understand about classical music .
i can ' t tell whether it ' s good or bad .
i answer , but i ' m sure you can tell whether you like it or not .
because i don ' t think any somebody says it , i don ' t know if i taste it , because i can ' t cook .
so , they ' re not t stop eating just because they can ' t cook .
so you don ' t have to rely of classical music either because you don ' t play an instrument .
listen consciously and tell whether you like it or not .
whether the music is too caltle or too sweet to you .
say what you feel .
over time , you also get offers , and want a little more spices in there , or even taste fine differences .
now why am i asking my audience to be active ?
because music is a language , and a language is there to communicate .
an artwork you never look at has no power to work .
the food was cookedly by a chef or a chef has to be eaten and not just looked at or traded recipes .
so please listen when a music is played .
it ' s not just a nice soundpet .
when in an environment where adults are actively performing music , or at least actively listening music , a child grows up , it ' s very easy for a music teacher to ask , what color does your flower have ?
can you play them in blue ?
and the child , after a memorial break , instead of a red flower , playing a blue flower .
and this sounds very different from it did before .
that was the first beginning of a own musical expression .
so the first step to interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today that was originally written a hundred years , two hundred ago , or even three hundred years ago ?
now , the instruments have progressed .
there was bach no piano as an a instrument .
it wasn ' t invented yet .
i think the bach would have thrilled if it had the acousticsibilities of today ' s modern pianos .
i can make today the sounds that the bach has had on the modern wing , which a renaissance cembal can ' t do .
you also know that he heard more than he had already become deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that an orchestra then rejected to be unmaginable .
that ' s why the composers depend on us performers to reinventeng the pieces .
so they listenble to what you ' ve just thought in the mind .
and also what you would think in the mind today .
or what i imagine today , because what you might have thought .
thank you .
you know what ' s envy ?
have you ever been jealous ?
and how did that feel ?
sorry .
i have a friend who drives a passerbi .
when i come with my little v . w . kn and me next , that feeling comes up .
i something shooting through my head .
i say , oof , what do you need a big car for ?
now that ' s lose losings half of its value in the first year .
and yet , you work much less than i do .
why do i have afford a little car like this ?
and then i realize that ' s unfair .
it ' s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , that unpleasant feeling is gone .
our organism invented a great method to just make such uncomasant feelings likealovyppear .
you can also try this it with words like revenge or profit or something like that .
i ' d want to give to you today something about or add something to that ' m unconsciously familiar with . today .
the mechanism is from lying .
but don ' t think about the lie , as you might have heard when people say no one has intention of building a wall .
and then stones up , so it shut their sight .
you a lie is that the liar itself doesn ' t believe what he ' s saying .
it ' s very easy to check that it has very different in mind .
he ' s just foolsing you and not himself .
no , the lie i ' m talking about has to do with dec foolsing yourself .
you need this lie to maintain a life sacrifice to sustain a self - deception .
they can make them less easily , yes , check them , or even collapse .
they need time .
there ' s an anecdote that you may know about .
the spanish painter leonardo picasso once portraited a woman .
this woman then complained , the portrait wouldn ' t see her similar to her .
picasso says , just wait .
it ' s getting more and more similar .
at this point , and when you laugh , you realize how important that lie is and how much time it takes to learn something that artists can share with us very well .
because artists have a disturbed relationship with lying .
the artist shares you something , and especially this lady , which she doesn ' t see when she just looks in the mirror .
the artist is to shares you something in a portrait that you get familiar with when you look at this piece of art over and over again .
then that unpleasant feeling disappears , it couldn ' t see them similar , and it gets more and more similar to you .
here you have this mechanism with which we can use lying as a great invention to stabilize our life .
and not only in art , also in the folk halls , in mythology , in stories it appears back .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked in the mirror every morning and asked him , who is the most beautiful in the country ?
one day this mirror says , yes , there ' s a more beautiful one .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility comes from this true existence , the mirror can ' t lie , comes from this true existence .
but we should just get familiar with the fact couldn ' t tell a woman that there ' s a more beautiful woman somewhere else .
here it is necessary to bring what we mean by politically correctness .
we need this lie at this point that sus keeps us deception without that we can ' t even live on .
we have stories not only in art , in folk poetry , but we also such great lies in science .
and there ' s this story about the priest of becrchester .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the origin of species and the descent of man .
that humans should derivete from the monkey and , yes , at least there would be a common ancestor between humans and apes .
and then she ran she ran to her husband and said , well , that ' s probably not true what charles is writing .
the human being supposed should derive from the monkey or have a common ancestor .
no , no , it that can ' t be done .
and if it ' s true , we need to prevent people from getting understanding about it .
why do we need to prevent people from getting understanding knowledge about something when it ' s true ?
because we can ' t live without these life lies .
because we have this self - deception , this feeling of being great , ancestry from the highest creatures , not from such a natural level , from something as unpredictable as a organism that exists , similar to a rock , and all things , that ' s unacceptable to us .
so , we can ' terate these things .
we need to prevent people from getting understanding things , especially when they ' re true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanism dissolves and what the traces look that it leaves that lead to something other than this great picture of ourselves , i want to give you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
my wife told me .
she came from school one day , she ' s a teacher , and she told about a student .
an autistic student .
she likes him , because he has a tendency to sincerity .
and she asked him , what are your hobbyes ?
and he says , well , i ' m in the fire department .
and because i ' m in the fire department , i ' m interested in pyromo mechanical things .
yes , you feel it when you ' re happy at this point . there ' s something wrong .
i told my wife that whenever a human being moral just uses the word because it , we should try to replace it with the word even though .
do that once , and then you get the sentence . even though i ' m in the fire department , i ' m interested in pyromoc things .
you feel that ' s the real truth behind the agreement .
that ' s a little bu , who he isn ' s t not really interested in fireting fire .
he ' s interested in fire .
but there are no clubs where we can look around at where you learn how to make fire .
there ' s only the second best thing , which is the fire department .
and there he signed up .
and by , you don ' t tell your teacher that you like to set fires somewhere and be delightd when the fires up after afterwards .
no , it just looks much better when we show that we ' re responsible to solve eliminate the risks that others will can do when they just fire .
here you s this little mechanism .
this is this evidence the fact that in inside the jack already knew that it was actually related to the fire , but it can ' t say it out loud .
here you have this censorsr between the unconscious and the conscious who moves immediately without able do anything about it , and the things that you know look very different designed so that they can sound much better for you and others .
that ' s what these words that we also use again in the language of politically correct speech over and over again .
in fact , we know that something else is the case .
but we know that when we say that , social relationships are very sensitive disrupted .
we can ' t just do that .
it ' s impossible to present these things in a society that needs should to work .
so i want to present to you what we ' ve found in my institute .
in which logic , this deception , this self - deception , the willingness , a different reality than we actually already know about in the unconscious that is valid spread the outside .
so i want to present you two , maybe three examples of this .
the first example assumes what many of you know and some of you value , very few of you don ' t need at all .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is something spiritual , says leibniz .
it ' s something that is not stop material , material nature .
and if you have people in front of you who are believe that they have a soul , or you can also say , who believe that they ' ve been brought by the soul to life , they think of it as if the soul is such a mental framework about them , not of matter , they just made out of flesh and blood , something stone , tied to the earth , eternalable , versetable , unrelevantable , dead .rel .
and now from of this soul you think that it ' s somehow present in this cloudy nature , in this aquatic nature , anima in latin , the buzz of air .
and then when that source of air flowss over man beings , it ' s filled with dignity , with mind , with nature that can only live , with soul .
and then he can just run off .
that ' s the idea of how the soul works .
so it ' s to get from to man the outside .
so we should seeve them as something that should necessarily be present to our lives .
and when you see that condition in mind , you understand the logic with which we experience that happiness being able to improve our world a lie .
because now you can apply a three - out .
you still know three from school .
now this is a three - sentence that describes a logic .
this is , by the way , is the hardest part of my talk .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
that is to that you can just apply this logic wrong .
in this three sentence , are three sentences occur .
the first sentence is , klaus argues claims there is no soul .
so the second sentence is , if klaus is right , then he has no soul .
now there ' s a third sentence .
i was high particularly impresseded here .
a third sentence , which immediately appears in people who have a strong sense of a soul .
they say who has no soul , who ' s dead and can ' t say anything at all .
and here you feel it .
here ' s this logic in this , yes , in this dec talk .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they are logically correct .
because i can say anything everything .
logic doesn ' t make statements about reality .
i can say the president is a man .
and if i ' m right , the president is a man .
if i ' m not right , the president is not a man .
logic doesn ' t make a statement about what ' s happens .
i can say anything .
but the what is , if i ' m right , it ' s true .
so when klaus says there is no soul .
second , if he ' s right , then he has no soul .
these things are logically correct .
and now our decing consciousness immediately feels , you can do something out of it .
it s on a third sentence , which has nothing to do with the first two sentences at all , and which pretends that the opposite of the first sentence is already proven and predic .
because actually , we had to prove whether there is the soul or not .
but with this logic , which it just uses that two sentences are logical correct , and a third , which looks like it has something to do with it , so that we can save our life .
so , we pretend that it ' s actually impossible to live without a soul .
and we ' re very happy about it .
we can continue these things in different examples .
for example in the present , we have a very modern example that fill the newspapers .
and you have to present another philosophical subject , a constant bart from philosophy .
this has to do with us going back to the fourth century .
there was a scholar named johannes buridanus , and that ' s why the buridan speaker is named .
the buridan lion is a lion made of pure nature .
he doesn ' t have that soul .
this is such a natural thing .
and if you put that exact in the middle of two identical hayves , it starvingves .
because he doesn ' t know which haystack to go first .
so he ' s right in the middle .
this is how the natural things are described .
equal forces with opposing arrow marks dis dissolve each other .
nothing happens at all .
but only if you get another example , so if you she immediately makes the one haystack bigger , it doesn ' t need reason and nothing to do .
automatically , he runs to the right thought .
so if you have this idea that you ' re driven in nature somehow , you being re detized by the bigger piles that attract you immediately , you also quickly feel that there must be something as a free will .
and if we ' re here in frankfurt on the main , i remember the max planck institute of brain science .
there ' s a scholar called wolf singer , and ' s sometimes told , wolf singer claims there ' s no freedom of freedom .
now we can start the second sentence again , and we can say , if wolf singer is right , then he doesn ' t have freedom .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can read in the newspaper almost day is what you find in this third sentence .
it looks something like who doesn ' t have freedom of freedom , can ' t be taken responsible for his actions and claims , and so he ' s uniustadeble .
again , you have it again .
in fact , you had to first prove if there was s something like freedom .
but the logic of deception enable allows us to pretend that the first sentence from the beginning is wrong , as course , of course , you have to accept the opposite without evidence .
and now you can simply , if you want to do anything yourself , if you want to test anything yourself , and especially , if you want to make people happy , practice that courage to lie .
for example , practice that , once you meet a person that you can say there ' s no predictions .
and please don ' t use the german word for predictors , which is prophet .
you can ' t call that , that would be a little bit politically inconsious again .
say there are no predictions .
immediately , you ' re going to learn one which there are of such predictions for , you can ' t prove that .
and they you have a problem .
because while you ' re busy realizing you can ' t prove there ' s no predictions , the man is quite happy .
he ' s very happy about this because he deceived her .
because he led them on a trip where he doesn ' t stop .
because actually , this person is not interested in evidence .
he ' s just interested in keepingping himself from the need to prove that there are predictions .
so , in the kind of shifting in evidence , you see the greatiance of lying .
and once you have a way to feel that three sentence in other people , you do , because you ' will make others happy if you don ' t remind them of your self actions that way .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good day .
i allowed myself to ask lilly if i mention her .
she ' s one of the hosts here of this great event , and she asked me if i want to give a talk here and present my idea .
i have to say honestly , you got it , it was hard for me talk about my idea .
and i may introduce my island project that i ' m trying to imagine you .
but , of course , the sum of , a lots of ideas .
i ' m probably , the two nice girls are still there , i ' m probably of the generation that made this bad eco image , because i ' nine started studying engineering in karlum , engineering college , now i think , it ' s called kit .
and then i then broke me berlin in the mid - 80s , because i wanted to make renewable energy , and it didn ' t happen in thesr .
there was the nuclear research facility in leopoldsha .
they were all called k at the time , and the july was called kfa .
they are now called project managers .
because a good engineer either built great cars or nuclear plants .
but something as stupid as a solar divide , which comes out sort of a hundred of watts out of the square meter , which was a toy .
and in berlin there was a crazy engineering collective .
i ' m grate to the premium kola person for having rehabtructed the word , because after the berlin wall , you couldn ' t use the wordmore , because everything on the left was bad .
but , t in the 80 -s it didn ' t .
there was , there were self - organized alternative companies , and one of them was just sitting in kreuzberg in the duesbornhof where they were suspected evil .
place of the terrorist bomb , but this was called desert technology , and made wind and solar power , and that ' s where i started in the mid - ' 80s .
and yes , a lot of what i ' s been said today was very touched by me because many , lots of beautiful expressions in that i ' ve also lived through .
i worked in the collective for 11 years , which was grassroots .
we were 20 people .
if one said no , the vetroprin , it completely crushed you . i ' ve spent 10 years , i ' ve been trying doubting if i could actually waste my great engineering college to a stupid thing , because all my father ' s colleagues always motivded him , you threw the money out the window with your kid .
it ' s about nonsense .
and this was really very , really bitter , and you get into such a period , just it just launched an picture going where i wonder myself after 10 years , a thousand d - marks were back then , basic wage , whole wage in the collective , of course , whether this was to really be the great thing .
and i ended kept it to six years , and then along with friends , i became the co - founder of the company solon , which then became along with spin - off q cells , one of the world ' s cell companies .
a huge success story , but again , of course , we have the problem of a growing company , and then we decided two thousand , a small group , decided that we ' re start and go back again and address the next issue of the future , and that means i think and we think , it ' s crazy again , that starts with people saying , what ' s the rubbi , that ' s not done , we ' re talk about memory . not . not '
and i brought you with a project that i want to introduce you now .
and the title of the talk was , how to get to a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started asking with a relatively simple crazy story , where could you possibly use a memory meaningfully today ?
on this island , this is the island of graciosa on the arizonas .
yes , that ' s the data .
there are four and a half thousand people there .
they have a rene share 15 percent renewable .
and the question is , why don ' t they have anymore ?
it just can ' t be technologically .
when you build more wind together each other , the system starts to fail .
i always tell politicians when they visit our facility adler our facility in berlin .
they always say , why ?
we already have 20 percent in germany .
there can ' t be a problem at all .
but it ' s not true , we have seven percent in europe , and our web is physically the european .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , you know that was two thousand2006 , the first contacts with the island , but just think about it .
how would actually have to be a battery like this so that you could make a island like this for 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe even 70 percent renewable .
and yes , i ' ll go another slide further .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , about a hundred gigawats units of being built the same based electricity in the world .
that ' s the power of a hundred nuclear power plants , because it ' s particularly fast everywhere .
the world ' energy that ' s happening is deleted with diesel because you don ' t need permission .
that ' s quick . it .
you put a box like this .
and then it usually looks like this .
always three them go by the diesels , two are always waited .
yes , this is what that down there is the burden .
we also got very accurate data .
and the wind system , or the solar system , or whatever it is , is usually a back - up system or a system that can only be embedded in small quantities here .
our goal was to say , okay .
the diesel becomes back - up , and the wind , the sun is using the load so that they can represent the larger portion .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewables , so energy per year , not power right now , you have to turn off the diesel .
that is , at right now , you have to make sure that renewables can sort of take over the whole grid .
of course , you can only do that if they ' re managed here in some way .
' nobody else in the world has done so before .
this is in a small way , so you can also use your razer through a little circuiter the .
people always ask me , what are you studying here at arnoldshof ?
that ' s be done .
but if you want to turn several of these circuitators and they ' re to build a network , that gets very complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to get to seven to nine percent renewable , and then here there ' s the rest here , the last rest , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable with , which becomes very , very expensive , and that ' s not going to work that you make this out of batteries .
that any will definitely be an source that will then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , or sh , that it will be .
they ' have to go more go to a seasonal storage and match fix winter - summer and not just day - night .
we just wanted to know what about a normal , supernormal electrochemical battery .
how far do you possibly get ?
and then they did a whole bunch of simulations .
and we simulateded wind and the sun and the load and came up with the conclusion , a very exciting result that compared the conventional system , which , after 20 years , you takes a median of about 50 cents a kilowatt - hour , you get about four and a half cents .
these were the first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
if that ' s great , we have a business model .
we ' re cheaper as the diesel system when the diesel price goes five percent a year .
and then we started negotiating with the insulars .
what did everything have to be done ?
havetia with investors , i ' ve looking for new societies .
now we were only five people to rebuild one rebuild the society .
and here ' s the picture .
the brown is sort of the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our system also has a price increase is because we ' re still doing 20 percent with diesel , and we ' re not going go through price increment on the other things .
and the power utility , which the electricity supply company on the island , has meant , we find that a great .
we also want to support , but we don ' t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin where we can sort of map the electrical electric conditions of the island by one to three .
that is , we first looked looking to find the world ' s largest battery .
here she is . here .
it ' s naturally from asia , in the case from japan .
and funny thing enough , it was developed at bbc mannheim , now ab ' 70s and then was focusedtedzed to the japanese .
it ' s you can see , it ' s a very , very large battery .
it ' has a megawatt of power , and it can do that power for six hours , and that ' s the battery that we ' ve kind of got simulation .
and then they set them up .
we ' ve also brought one of these diesel sets the same size that it ' s there , into the hall , to actually the complete dynamic behavior of this network , so in the hall it looks like this , there the diesel , here ' s the big battery , here are s all the circuits that we simulate the network .
over here , we simulate the whole transmission control system , the mile physics of the cables , to kind of map the vibration behavior on the net .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we can also turn two hundred kilowatts of solarvoltaics on the grid .
here we see again here we see the diesel again here ' s all the whole single sets .
and what we ' ve been doing , for two thousand years the hall has been finished , to this day two thousand , almost everything that ' was been developed here between the single system of electronics , software , we ' ve done .
so we ' re not battery manufacturers , we define oursel as a company that just between the issue of battery and the issue of net and everything in between .
of course , you have to communicate to the battery , you ' ve have to be able to communicate to the web , and that ' s very complicated .
the beauty is about the issue that on this island basically to anticipate about the problems that we ' re going to get if we want to increase our share of renewables .
so this whole discussion of about how ' s going move back and forth right now , energy use , how to go , on the island , for example , five and a half to 30 percent electricity energy , so we ' re tire shading the wind and turning the sun .
of course light then offers smart grid .
so smart grid , a huge theme everywhere .
we can already start the integrating electrocomobil , ask around , because you can manage the load .
that is , if you ' re renewable at seven percent , you ' t be to do that without memory .
you can go through smart grid , you can , by building the nets , yes , definitely you should definitely , listen to the share , but you ' re never going be able to let avoid of memory .
and that ' s a little bit of the message .
that ' s why a lot of people come there and look at this because you can see what problems you get .
when we turn off the diesel , you don ' t have this rotating mass that creates a certain amount of inertia on the grid .
and our european network grid is basically made up of all rotating masses of large power plants , where the wave is rotating all around europe .
we look into this net , we see the 50 hertz , and when it becomes nine and a half - point nine hertz , we start up a few valves , then a little mer of steam goes in , and then we get up again .
this is the system .
and of course , this is incredibly wearust .
if you blow that down somewhere , it takes a while .
the spinning reserve has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in time , you can react to something again .
if you don ' t have that anymore , that rotating mass , you have to replace that with power electronics and electrochemicals .
and we can turn out two milliseconds in with this big battery .
and then you see the enormous speed opportunities are .
and the message is , we need to avoid these rotating masses if we kind of have our goals 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 , 30 percent and so on , if we want to reach them at all .
then we have to break down our must - run capacity on the net .
must - run is simply the power station is running on to keep the frequency .
yes , that ' s a huge debate right now , coal plant , because we don ' t , or hospital facilities , because that can ' t be done .
and we ' re just trying to make it clear that you can break down the capacity , the must - run capacity by bringing electrochemical storage into the web .
and fortunately , there ' a lot of studies to that now .
and to do that , people always come and look at our test on , sort of , our island test state .
and yes , the discussion is always about how far can you take a little bit long future ?
and a lot of the discussions i ' ve had in the last six years have were been similar to the discussion i ' ve had in the last 30 years about photovoltaics .
can ' t , it ' s stu , play stuff , we calculated everything , never calculate .
we have 30 gigawatt solarvoltaics in germany today .
this is excellent .
and i just assume that in the next 30 years , we ' ll have the same capacity of electrochemical storage around over the world .
very simply , that ' s how it will happen .
there will be a lot of resistance and arguments .
the nice thing is that i ' ve sort of seen now in the last two years now scientists are putting on my side .
we ' ve now got over 10 million funding projects now , also to plug a 10 megawatt battery on the german grid .
this will happen next april .
so from ' s you also realize that there ' s a change , and just from that defense to yes to the idea that a hundred percent renewable is right .
and if you have a percent renewable , it ' s like an self - sustaining system .
so far , in discussion we ' s always many trying to , these insulators , they do self , they have their own little net , because it that has nothing to do with our each community .
the question is very simple , if you make completely independent of any fossil or uranium energy sources that are being drille out somewhere in the world and brought to you , you ' re an island .
then they only use only what ' s there in the sun and the wind where they live .
and that ' s a little bit of our vision of clean energy supply , and i ' m also gra cradle to cradle that you said you use solar energy .
and that ' s what we do , and so , the talk from premium kola , that you can allowed to be a collective again and use solar energy , a little bit together here .
and yeah , i ' just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be quiet be a little crazy and also have a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty tough it , but i think it ' s done .
thank you .
when steve lopez , the , los angeles timesist , walked in the streets in the downtown of los angeles one day , he heard a wonderful music .
it came from a man , an african - american , sy , rough , homeless , playing on a violin that had only two strings .
many of you will know the story , because from steve ' s article about it later became a book that was filmed again , with robert downey junior as steve lopez and jamie foxx as nathaniel anthony ayers , the bassistist who studied at juilliard university and whose promising career tragically ended early by his paranoid schizophrenia .
nathaniel left juilliard , suffered a mental collapse , and 30 years later he lived as a homeless man on the streets of skid row in downtown los angeles .
i recommend all of you to read steve ' s book or look at the film , so that you can not only understand the wonderful connection that came between these two men , but also how the music helped that connection , and how it was the instrument when this word game is allowed to get the opportunity nathaniel away from the street . s . i . look .
i met mr . ayers in 2008 , two years ago , at the walt disney concert hall .
he had just heard a performance of beethoven ' s first and fourth symphony and came behind the stage to imagine me .
he spoke in a very happy and sentimental tone about yo - yo ma and hillary clinton and how the dodgers would never make it to the baseball world series , and all of all because of the flcious passage of the first violin in the last sentence of beethoven ' s fourth symphony .
we came to about the subject of music , and a few days later , i got an email saying that nathaniel was interested in violin lessons .
i have to mention that nathaniel refused a medical treatment , because he had already been treated with electrosh shocks and thades and handcuffs , a trauma that followed him his whole life .
as a result , he ' s now particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic periods - , - they ' re sometimes so bad , and he disappears for days , walks around the streets of skid row , exposed to this horror and the torture horror of his own mind .
and in exactly a stimuling period that was nathaniel when we started our first lesson in the walt disney concert hall , and he had this insan crackickerill in his eyes and he completely lost .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke , and how someone wanted to poison him in sleep .
i was afraid , not right me , but i was afraid that i could lose him , that he could sink into one of his conditions , and that i could destroy him his relationship to the violin if i started talking about scale and ars and other exciting forms of educational violin .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven ' s violin concert .
and as i was playing , i noticed that in nathaniel ' s eyes , there was a total change was happen on .
it was like he was standing under the effect of an invisible drug , a chemical reaction whose catalyst was my game .
nathaniel ' s manic anger turned into understanding , into a calm curiosity and grace .
and like a miracle , he took his violin and he began playing some pieces of violin concerts after , and then asked me to play it : mendels sho , mozakov , siberia .
we then started talking about music from bach to beethoven , brahms , bruner and all the other bs , from bartok all the way to eska - cafes .
and i realized that not only did he have a encyclopedia knowledge about music , but he also a close personal relationship with her .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that otherwise i only know from my colleagues at the philharmonic of los angeles .
by playing music and talking about music , from this paranoid , confused man who had just moved through the streets of los angeles , had become a loving , educated , brilliant musician at juilliard .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music means mental health .
because music allows him to transform his thoughts and his delusions with his imagination and creativity into something real .
and so he escape escaped of his agonizing conditions .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
that ' s why we make music : so that we can form something that is lies inside all of us , deep inside us , shape our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity to reality .
and the reality of that expression comes reaches all of us , moving , inspired and united unites us .
what nathaniel looked at the music him back to a community of friends .
the transbuling power of music brought him back to a family of musicians who understood him , who realized his talent and respectedd him .
and i ' m always going to keep playing with nathaniel , whether at the walt disney concert hall or skid row , because he reminds me of why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno giuometi : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i suregely stole from the cellists .
i hope you will ll forgive me .
so i ' ve known a lot of fish in my life .
i only loved two .
this first one , which was more like a passionate affair .
it was a beautiful fish , tasty , good texture , richful , a best sellingr on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , it was bred in aquaculture to the supposedly highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel comfortable selling it .
i had a relationship with for several months with this beauty .
one day , the head of the company called and asked if i could speak at an event about the sustainability of the farm .
" of course , " i said .
here was a company trying to solve what has become this unimaginable problem for our chefs . how do we keep fish on our menus ?
in the last 50 years , we ' ve been fished the oceans as cutting forests .
it ' s hard to overestimate the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish , the ones we love , the tunas , the healing butter , the salmon , the swordfish , they collapsed .
there ' s almost nothing left .
so maybe you probably or bad aquature , fish farming , going will be part of our future .
a lot of arguments about it . fish farming plants pollute the environment , most of them anyway , and they ' re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a 15 to one food rate .
that means 15 pounds of wild fish is needed to get one a pound of breeding tuna .
not very sustainable .
it doesn ' t taste very well either .
so here finally , was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
the day before the event , i called the head of publication for the company .
let ' s call him don .
" don , " i said , " just to get the facts right , you ' re famous for growing so far out there in the sea that you don ' t contae the environment . "
" that ' s , " he said . " we ' re so far out there that the waste is distributed from our fish , not concentrated . "
and then he said , " we ' re basically a our own world .
this food feeding from 2 . 5 to one , " he said .
" the best in the industry . "
two . five to one , great .
" 2 . 5 to one what ? what are you feeding ? "
" sustainable proteins , " he said .
" great , " i said . i set up .
and that evening , i was lying in bed thinking , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day , just before the event , i called don .
i said , " don , for what example , what are sustainable proteins ? "
he said he didn ' t know . he ' s going to ask .
well , i talked to ach people in the company . no one could give me a proper answer , until i finally talked to the senior biologist .
let ' s call him don .
" don , " i said , " for example , what are sustainable proteins ? "
well , he mentioned some algae and some fish flries , and then he said , chicken pellets .
i said , " chicken pellets ? "
he said , " yes , feathers , skin , bone flour , bones , dried and processed for food . "
i said , " how much percent of your food is chicken ? "
ass maybe two percent .
" well , that ' s about 30 percent , " he said .
i said , " don , what ' s sustainable about feeding chicken to fish ? "
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , " there ' s just too much chicken in the world . "
i fell in love with this fish .
no , not because i ' m a self - righteous enjoy and a good person .
i am actually am .
no , i actually fell in love with this fish because i swear to god who tasted fish for chicken after that conversation .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love story .
it ' s the romantic way , the way in which the better you know your fish , you love the fish the more .
i first eat ate it in a restaurant in southern spain .
a friend of journalist had been talking about this fish for a long time .
it kind of messed us up .
he came to the table with a bright almost glowing white color .
the chef had sold it .
hold twice .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
who can make a fish taste so well after it ' s sold ?
i can ' t , but this guy can .
let ' s call him miguel . in fact , ' s miguel .
and no , he didn ' t cook the fish , and he ' s not a chef , at least in the way that you and i understand below it .
he ' s a biologist at veta la palma .
this is a fish refculture in the northwestern corner of spain .
it ' s near to the mouth of the river guadalvir river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argentinaans .
they were growing meat cattle on which was basically wetlands .
they did that by waterriga watering the land .
they built this complicated series of canals , and they pushed water out of the country and out into the river .
well , they couldn ' t make this work , not economically .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
it killed about 90 percent of the birds , which is a lot of birds for this place .
and so in 1982 , a spanish environmental awareness company bought the country .
what did they do ?
they ' ve reversed the flow of water .
they literally switched the lever .
instead of pushing the water out , they used the canals to pull the water back in .
they flooded the canals .
they created an 11 , 000 - hectare of fish ref - bahamask , seaba , shrimp , aa - and in miguel and his company have completely reversed the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you ' ve never seen anything like this before .
they stare out at the horizon that ' s a million miles away , and all you see is flooded canals and this dense , lush march .
i was there not a long ago with miguel .
he ' s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and a part " a crocodile to kiss . "
okay ? there we were fighting through the wetlands , and i m waking and sweating , have mud up to my knees , and miguel gives a biology lecture quietly .
here he highlights a rare fot rod .
now he mentions the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
and here , here he sees a pattern of bunds that reminds him of the tanzanian giraffe .
it turns out that miguel spent most of his career in the mikumi national park in africa .
i asked him how he became such a fish expert .
he said , " fish ? i don ' t know about fish .
i ' m an expert in relationships . "
and then he goes and turns into more talk of rare birds and algae and weird water plants .
and don ' t get me wrong , it was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community was dumging , like that way .
it ' s great , but i was in love .
and my head got weak over this deli piece of delicious fish that i had the previous .
so i interrupted it . i said , " miguel , how come your fish tastes so good ? "
he pointed at the algae .
" i know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that ' s incredible .
but what do your fish eat ?
what is the food rating ? "
well , he goes on to tell me tell me that it ' s such a rich system that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
the plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zoo plankton , that ' s what feeds the fish .
the system is so healthy , it ' s completely self - fueling .
there ' s no food .
ever heard of about a farm that doesn ' t feed its animals ?
later the day , i was driving around this site with miguel , and i asked him , i said , " for a place that seems to be so natural , " unlike any farm i ' d ever been on , " how do you succeed ? "
at that moment , it was like a film filmmaker had asked to a change on stage .
and we went around the corner , and we found the most incredible view , thousands and thousands of pink flamingos , a literally pink carpet as far as the eye .
" that ' s success , " he said .
" look at your belly , pink .
they swim . "
swimming ? i was totally confused .
i said , " miguel , don ' t you drag your fish ? "
" yes , " he said .
" we ' re losing 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to the birds .
well , last year site there were 600 , 000 birds on this , more than 250 different species .
it ' s become the largest and one of the most important private bird reserves in europe .
i said , " miguel , isn ' t a well - thving bird colony the last thing you want to have on a fish farm ? "
he shook his head , no .
he said , " we ' re building efficientivelly , not intensely .
this is an ecological network .
the flamingos are eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the pinker the belly the better the system . "
okay , let ' shink this . a farm that doesn ' t feed their animals and a farm that doesn measures its success in the health of their its predators .
a fish breeding , but also a bird reserve .
oh , and by the way , these flamingos shouldn ' t even be there the beginning .
they breed in a city 240 kilometers away where the soil quality is better for nest maintenance .
every morning they fly 240 kilometers to the farm .
and every night they fly back 240 kilometers .
they do it because they can follow the cut white line along the highway a2 .
seriously .
i had imagined a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at miguel .
i said , " miguel , do you fly miles to the farm and then do you fly back kilometers at the night ?
do you do that for the kids ? "
he looked at me like i had just quoted a song by whitney houston .
he said , " no . they do it because the food is better . "
i didn ' t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don ' t like a fish skin . i don ' t like it sc . i don ' t like it cruisy .
it ' s this bitterng , clned taste .
i almost never cook with it .
and yet , when i tried it in this restaurant in southern spain , she didn ' t taste it the fish meat at all .
it tasted sweet and pure , as if you were taking a little bit of the ocean .
i mentioned this to miguel , and he was noddindg .
he said , " the skin looks like a sponge .
it ' s the last defense before anything hits the body .
it ' s evolved throughout evolution to suck uprients . "
and then he said , " but our water has no insutanities . "
okay . a farm that doesn ' t feed your fish . a farm that doesn measures its success on its predators .
and then i realized , when he says a farm that doesn has t no insutants , he underunder tremenunderminemines , because the water that flows through this farm comes in from the river of guadalvir river .
it ' s a river that carries all the things that rivers today tend to lead , chemical pollutants , flow of pest controlts .
and when it got through the system and that leaves , the water is cleaner than how it got in .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm that doesn ' t feed your animals , not just a farm that measuress its success in health of its predators , but a farm that is literally a water treatment plant , and not just for these fish , but also for you and me .
because when the water flows out , it versi dives in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i ' ll take it , and you should do that too , because this love story , as romantic , is also telling .
you might say that it ' s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we ' re talking about cape or meat cattle .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , one where food actually taste good .
but for many people , that ' s a little too radical .
we ' re not realists , we ' re loverss . we ' re lovers .
we love farmers ' markets . we love small family businesses . we talk about local food . we eat organic .
and if you say that these are the things that assure the future of good food , somebody stands up somewhere and says , " hey guys , i love pink flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? "
can i be honest ?
i don ' t like that question .
no , not because we ' re already producing enough calories to feed the world more than .
a billion people will starving today .
a billion - that ' s more than ever before - because of massive inequilities in distribution , not in overall production .
now , i don ' t like that question because it ' s determinedd the logic of our food system over the last 50 years .
food grains to herb eaters , pest - control to monopoliicses cultures , chemicals to the earth , chickens to fish , and all the time the agriculturalness industry has simply asked , " if we feed more people cheaper , how terribleful can that be ? "
that was the cause . it was rightification . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call it what it is , a business in development , a business that rapidly supports ecological capital that enables that kind of production .
this is not a industry , and it ' s not agriculture .
our grain chamber is threatened today , not because of declining capacity , but because of declining resources .
not through the latest mahle and tractors inventions , but through fertile land , not through pumpsing , but through fresh water , not through chains , but through forests , not through fishing boats and nets , but through fish in the sea .
they want to feed the world ?
let ' s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better yet , how can we create conditions that empower every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don ' t look at the agriculturalness model for the future .
it ' s really old , and it ' s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are up there , and it ' s never produced anything really good for food .
instead , let ' s look at the ecological model .
this is the one that goes back to two billion years of labor experience .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
businesses that aren ' t worlds for themselves , businesses that rebuildingming instead of dumling , businesses that growing intensively rather than just intense , farmers that are not just producers , but experts on relationships .
because they ' re the people who are also experts on flavor .
and if i ' m really honest , you ' re a better chef than i ' ll ever be .
you know , i ' m right , because if that ' s the future of good food , it ' s going to be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to give you one thing to today is that the total of data we consume is larger than the sum of its parts , and instead of thinking about information transmission , i want you to think about how we can use information as that patterns emerge and we recognize trends that otherwise would not have been visible . today . that .
so , what we see here is a typical death chart of age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it ' s called pivot , and what i can do with pivot is i filter after a certain cause of death , say accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that comes .
and that ' s because in the middle here , people are the most active , and they ' re the most vulnerable over here .
we can take a step further out and then rearrange the data , and see that cardiocular disease and cancer are the common suspects , but not for everyone .
now if we continue and rankate after age , we say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are even the main cause people should be worry about .
and if you continue further research , ' is particularly true for men .
so you realize that the look of information and data really remi a reminisce like swimming in a living information graph .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not for content itself ?
so what we have here are the covers of every single sports illustrated that have ever been printed .
it ' s all here . it ' s all online .
you can like to test it after my talk in your rooms .
with pivot , you can dive in a decade .
you can dive in a particular year .
you can jump directly to a specific copy .
now if i look at here , i see the athletes that appear in this article and the sports .
i ' m a list armstrong fan , so i click here , to show me all the exes in which warren armstrong is mentioned .
now , if i just want to get a rougher overview , i could think , " ok , what if i look at everything about bike ? "
so i ' m going to take a step back and extend the perspective .
now i see greg lemond .
and so you get an idea of that if you search this kind of information , more targeted , zoom bigger , zoom in , zoom out , you ' re ' not looking or you ' not just surfing .
you do something that is actually a little different .
it ' s something in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
now i want to take this idea a little bit further with something a little crazy .
what we ' ve done here is we ' ve taken every single wikipedia site and reduced it to a little summary .
the summary contains a short preview and a symbol of the area that it comes from .
i ' m just showing the top 500 of the most popular wikipedia sites .
but even in this narrow view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately we get a sense of the topics that are most popular on wikipedia .
now i ' m going to vote choose the issue of government .
now , after i elected government , i realize that the wikipedia categories that are most concerned with it are time magazines are " people of the year . "
this is really important , because this is an a insight that ' s not in a single wikipedia site .
that ' s only to recognize if you step back and look at the whole thing .
looking at a particular of these summaries , i can then go into the time magazine " people of the year , " and see everyone all together .
now when i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of them are government officials , some come from science , some , less , come from the business . here ' s my boss , and one comes from the music sphere .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
so we can jump and look at all the ted prize winners .
you can see , we ' re surfing the web for the first time as if it ' s really a web , not just side to side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you something else that might be a little surprise .
i ' m just going to show you the new york times website here .
pivot , this application - i don ' t want to call it a browser ; it ' s really not a browser , but you can look at websites with it - and we bring this zoom technology to every single website like this .
so i can take a step back and jump right to a specific group .
so this is important because only by looking at websites in this way you can look at the entire internet network in the same way .
so i can zoom in my course in a certain time frame .
here ' s the state of the whole demonstration that i ' ve kept here the moment .
and i can sort of bring back everything i ' ve looked at today .
and if i take step out and look at everything , i can maybe rearrange my course maybe for my search past . here , i ' ve been looking for nepotis , here for bing , or here for live labs pivot .
and from here , i can go into the site and call it back .
it ' s a metaphor that ' s used over and over again , and every time it makes the picture larger than the sum of the data bits .
right now , in this world , we think data is a curse .
we ' re talking about the curse of flow of information .
we ' re talking about " drowning in information . "
what if we could turn this situation and turn the internet upside down , so that instead of always going from one to another , we can begin to go a lot of things to a lot of things , and discover patterns that would have otherwise been hidden ?
if we can do that , then this previous data trap will perhaps a new source of useful information .
and instead of just moving in information , we can get knowledge about it .
and if we learn know , maybe we can even draw wisdom out from it .
so that i ' ll stop , thank you very much .
i grew up with a certain amount of science fiction .
when i was in high school , i went to school in , an hour a hour every day .
and my nose was always in a book , a science fiction book that transped my thoughts to other worlds , and in a narrative way satisfied my deep lying , unpreing curiosity .
this curiosity also showed in the that every time i wasn ' t in school , i was walking through the forests , walking and collecting " samples , " frogs and snakes and beetles and pond water , brought everything home and looking under the microscope .
i was totally science doctor , you know .
it was all about trying to understand the world and explore the limits of the possible .
and my love of science fiction seemed to be reflected in my environment , because back then in the late ' 60s , we went to the moon and explore the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows showing us animals and places and a world of wonder that we could never imagined before .
and that ' probably has been quite well to this science fiction role .
and i was an artist . and .
i could draw . i could paint .
and because there were no video games or this over of computer - generated movies or all the imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we ' s all had to at the time . when we read a book as children , we took the description of the author and we projected it on the screen in our heads .
my reaction to that was to drawing and painting alien , alien worlds , robots , spacecraft and all that sort like that .
in math class , i was constantly caught by the teacher , hiding behind my textbook .
creativity had to somehow get outhow .
and something interesting happened that , because what fascinated me about jacques cousteau ' s shows was the idea of a completely unknown world here on our earth .
i certainly m , i ' would d never reach an alien world with a spaceship , which that seemed pretty unlikely to me .
but here was a world that i could actually enter here on earth , and it was as fascinating and exotic as all i ' d always imagined when i had read these books .
so when i was 15 , i decided to a diver .
the only problem with this was that i lived in a small village in canada 1 , 000 miles away from the nearest ocean .
but i didn couldn ' t both myself by that .
i annoyed my father until he finally found a dive school in nashville , new york , right on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my dive in a pool ymca in the middle of the winter in nashville , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i didn ' t seen see two years later when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years that have been running , i ' ve spent about 3 , 000 hours underwater , 500 hours of them in submersibles .
and i ' ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the shallowter oceans , is as rich in fascinating life as we can ' t really imagine .
nature ' s imagination does has no boundaries , unlike to our own misely human imagination .
to this day , i feel deepest awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love of the ocean continues with the same intensity as ever .
when i chose a profession as an adult , it was filming .
that seemed the best way combine my inner urge to tell stories , with my need to create images .
as a child , i kept drawing comic books and so on .
so films movies were the way to bring images and stories together . that fit together .
of course , the stories i picked were from the science fiction field : " terminator , " aliens , " and " abyss . "
in " abyss , " i could connect my preference for the underwater world and diving with filming .
so my two passions are fuose .
something interesting happened in " abyss " : to solve a fictional problem in this film - and that was that we had to create a kind of liquid water system - we went back to computer - generated animation , cg .
what we came out was the first computer - generated soft - surface figure that ever seen in a movie .
the film didn ' t raise any money , in fact , it was just playing its cost , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was like hypnotized by the magic that came coming out of it .
according to arthur clarke ' s law , course , advanced technology and magic are no longer different from .
so they saw something magical .
and that was incredibly exciting .
and i thought , " wow , that ' s really got to be involved in the movie art . "
so we went a further into " terminator 2 , " my next movie , .
together with ilm , we created this guy out of liquid metal there , and the success was depende all on how this effect would happen .
and it worked . again , we had created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we ' ve already played a little bit more money with the movie .
from these two experiences , a whole new world has reached , a whole new world of creativity for film - makers .
so i started a company , along with my good friend stan winston , who was the best make and creature designer at that time , called digital domain .
the basic idea of this company was to skip the phase of analog processes with optical printers and etc . and to start digital production .
then we did , and we gave us a competitive advantage for a while .
but in the mid - 1990s 90s , we realized that in creature and character design - which we actually started the company - we were starting to moving move .
i had written this piece , " avatar , " which would push the measurement sheet in visual effects and computer - generated effects at whole new heights , with realistic human , expressive characters made with using cg , and the main characters should all be cg , and the world should be cg .
but the measuring chart printed back , and the people in my company told me that we ' re not able to do this yet .
so i shifted that on and i made this other film about the big ship that ' s falling .
the film studio i sold this as " romeo and juliet on a ship , " it became a love epic scale , a passionate movie .
but secretly i actually wanted to dive down to the real wreck of the titanic .
that ' s why i made the film .
that ' s the truth . but the studio didn ' t know .
but i convinced them by saying , " we re diving to the wreck . we ' filming the real wreck .
we ' re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
that ' s incredibly important . it ' s a good hang for marketing . "
and i persua convincedded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but that ' s back on the fact that your imagination can create a reality .
we actually created six months later a in where i found myself in a russian submersible four miles beneath the surface of the north atlantic , looking at the real titanic through a bullnose .
this wasn was t a movie , this wasn ' not hd movie , this was real .
so , that really blew my mind .
and the preparation for this was enormous . we had to build cameras and headlights and all sorts of things .
and i noticed how much these deep - sea dives were like a space mission .
well , they were also high - tech , and they needed more planning .
you get into this capsule , then youoat down into this dark , hostile environment where there ' s no hope for rescue if you can ' t make it back .
and i thought , " wow , that ' s just as like i was in a science fiction movie .
that ' s really cool . "
i was really obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
anyway , in the part that deals with curiosity and science . it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that couldn ' t hollywood couldn ' t give me .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could then create a visual effect for , but i couldn ' t imagine what i would see outside the window .
in some of the following expeditions , i ' ve seen creatures in thermal sources , and sometimes things that i ' d never seen before , sometimes things that no one had ever seen before , and for which science we saw themn ' t found words at time .
so that really threw me right , and i wanted more .
and so i made a slightly unusual decision .
after the success of " titanic , " i said to myself , " okay , i want to quit my day job as a filmmaker in hollywood , and i ' ll to be a full - time researcher for a while . "
and then we started , we dived to the eagle , and we explored them with robotic vehicles .
we went back to the titanic .
we took little robots that we built that wrapped in a fiberglassd .
our intention was to dive in and look at the inside of the ship , which had never been done before .
no one had ever explored the inside of the wreck . you hadn ' t had any means to do it yet , so we developed the technology .
and , there i am sitting , on the deck of the titanic , in a submersible , seeing plan that are pretty much like these boards and i know the band used to played there .
and i ' m fly a little robotic through the hallways of the ship .
i ' m actually using it , but my consciousness is inside the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically in the titanicack .
this was the most surreal form of a deja - vu i ' ve ever experienced , because before i gotped around a corner , i always knew what was going to appear in the light bu of the vehicle , because i had been through the movie set for months when we were making the movie .
because the set was a precise copy of the blueprint of the ship .
so this was a very strange experience .
she made me reali with this telepresence experience that you can use such robotic avatars and move your consciousness into the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
it was really incredibly profound .
and maybe a little look at what might happen in a few decades if you have cyborg bodies to explore something or do other things , in all sorts of post - human future scenario that i can imagine as a science fiction fan .
after these expeditions , we began to appreciate what we ' d seen down there , for example , these deep - sea sources , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals - . - these are sort of aliens , but here on earth .
they live with chemosynthesis .
they don ' t exist in a sunlight - based system like we do .
and so you see animals right next to a 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also very interested in space science , which was the science fiction influence of my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and who are in do with nasa and are sitting at the nasa council and planning real space missions , they go to russia , and they go through the biomedical protocol with everything stuff and everything , then go to the international space station and take our 3d camera systems .
that was fascinating .
but in the end it turned out that i took space scientists into the deep sea .
i took them and i gave them access to the world down there : astrologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the sources so they could look around , take samples and test instruments and so on .
we did documentaries , but we actually did science , in fact , space science .
so the circle formed between my existence as a science fiction fan , then as a child , and implementation into reality .
in the course of this voyage , i learned a lot .
i ' ve learned a lot about science , but i think a director must be able to lead , be a leader like a ship captain or something .
but i didn ' t understand much about leadership before i began these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say to myself , " what am i doing here ?
why do i do that ? what comes happens out ? "
these stupid movies don ' t make us money .
we ' re playing the cost of production . none no .
everybody think i ' d run away between " titanic " and " avatar , " and d had fired my nails on a towel somewhere on the beach .
i made all these films , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what do you doing ?
you do it for the task , for the challenge - and the ocean is the most challenging environment that you have . you do it because of the exploration , and because of the strange connection that comes when a small group of people form a team .
because we did all of this with just 10 to 12 people who ' been working together working continuously , and sometimes we were out sea two to three months in a row .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the awareness you have front of each other , because you ' ve done a task that you can ' t explain to anyone else .
if you come back to the land and you say to yourself , " we had to do it , the fiberglass , the sound , and the all way around it , all the technology , and all the difficulties , the human performance if you ' work on sea , " you can ' t explain the other . it ' s like policemen or soldiers who have been through something together and know that they can never explain it to somebodybody . explain .
there s a connection , a mutual respect .
so when i came back to make my next film , " avatar , " i tried to apply the same leadership , which is that you respect your team and deserve it in return .
and this really changed the dynamic .
so here i was back again with a little team on unknown terrain , and weted " avatar " with a new technology that didn ' never exist before .
incredibly exciting .
a tremendous challenge .
and we became a real for a four and a half year years a family .
so my way of making films changed completely .
there were people who thought we really did done these ocean creatures well , and transported it to the planet pandora .
for me , it was more of a principle way of doing my job , the actual process that changed in the result .
so what can we close from all of this ?
what lessons have we learned ?
i think the first of all is curiosity .
it ' s the most powerful human feature .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and your team ' s attention is more important than all merit in the world .
come have young filmmakers who say , " give me a advice how to do this . "
and i say , " don ' t shut yourself .
others do this for you . don ' t do it to yourself , don ' t bet yourself . take risks on yourself . "
nasa has a favorite sentence : " failure is not an alternative . "
but in art and in exploration , failure has must to be an alternative , because that ' s it guarantees a trust benefit .
no important effort that required innovation was ever addressed without a risk .
you have to be prepared to take those risks .
that ' s the idea i ' d like to leave you with . failure is an alternative , but fear is not . thank you .
today i ' m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
and this may not surprising this , because my full - time engagement at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds , to the things that we need to invent and deliver to make the poorest 2 billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , actually more important than everyone else on the planet .
climate change means that their seeds won ' t grow for many years ; we rain too much or too little ; things will change way it cannot their fragile environment .
this that it leads to famineon . it leads to uncertainecuty . it leads to riots .
so , a climate change is going to be terrible for you .
and also , the energy price for them is very important .
in fact , if you could only reduce the price from one thing , to reduce poverty reduction , energy would be far most effective .
well , the energy price has fallen over time .
in fact , the progress society is based on energy gains .
the desert revolution drove the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century there was a rapid fall in electricity prices , and that ' s why we have refrigerators , air conditioners , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we ' re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce price - let ' s cut the price - we meet a new barrier , and that barrier is related to co2 .
co2 heats up the planet , and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they multiply the co2 emitted , which leads to temperature warming , and that temperature warming has some very negative implications - effects on the weather and perhaps worse , the indirect consequence that the natural ecosystems cannot adapt such rapid changes , and whole systems collapse . they
now , the exact relationship between co2 increase and the temperature changes in result , and where the other implications are , there are some ambiguities , but not very many .
and there ' s certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences will , but they will be extremely bad !
i asked the top scientists several times , " do we really need to get down to near zero ?
isn ' t enough half or a quarter ? "
the answer is , until we get near to zero , the temperature will continue to increase .
that ' s why it ' s a big challenge .
it ' s very different from saying , we have a three - foot truck that has to go under a three - foot bridge , and you can kind of sqeze underneath it .
this has to go going the way down , to zero .
well , we emit a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons .
every american about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it ' s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and somehow we have to create changes that go that down to zero .
it ' s been gone so far .
only different economic changes have actually influenced it , and we need to go from rapid increase to reduction and to a reduction to zero .
this equation has four factors : a little bit of multiplcation . you have this thing on left - co2 - that you want to get to towards zero , and that will depend on the number of people , the services that every person uses on average , the average energy for every service and the co2 that ' s emi per every unit of energy .
so let ' s look at every factor in individual single and think about how we get that to zero .
probably one of these numbers has to get very close to zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let ' s go through it .
first , we have the population .
today , 6 . 8 billion people live .
and it goes up to nine billion . moving to nine billion .
if we ' re very successful with new vaccines , health care and reproductive medicine , we could probably reduce that by 10 percent to 15 percent , but right now we ' re seeing a 1 . 3 .
the second factor is the services that we use .
that includes everything the food that we eat , clothing , television , heating .
these are very good things , and poverty reduction means making these services available to almost everyone on the planet .
it ' s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could probably make miss and use less , but on average , that number will increase every year , so therefore it more than double , the number of services that are provided per person .
here ' s a very fundamental service . is there light at home so you can read the homework ?
and these students don ' t have , so they go out and read their schoolworks under the street .
now , with efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there ' s finally s good news .
we have something that doesn ' t go up .
because of various successes in the lighting sector , through other car types , through new methods in building , there are many services that energy use , some individual services can reduced by 90 percent .
in other services , like making fertilizers , 105 : 00 : 05 : 56 , 000 - & gt ; 00 : 05 : 58 , 000 or air traffic or air travel , the space for improvements is much smaller .
in total , if we ' re optimistic , maybe we might get a reduction by a factor three or maybe even a factor six .
but in the first three factors , we ' ve now gone from 26 billion to maybe at least 13 billion tons , and that ' s just not enough .
so let ' s look at the fourth factor - and this is going to be a key factor - that is the amount of co2 being produced per every unit of energy .
the question is , can you get that to zero ?
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every manufacturing method electricity production emits co2 today , except renewables and nuclear energy .
so what we need to do on a global level is create a new system .
we need energy miracles .
now when i use the term " wonder , " i don ' t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and its services is a miracle .
the people here have contributed to develop a lot of these wonders .
usually there ' s no deadline that you need a miracle to a certain date .
normally you ' re basically just standing in , and some come , some people don ' t .
but in this case , we have to give and get a miracle in very short time .
well , i wondered , how can i really actually get this across ?
is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that spark sparks people ' s ideas here ?
i remember last year i was brought mosquitoes , and some ofhow people like that .
the idea became really tangible for you , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , i came up with this .
i decided that releaseing fireflies would be my year s contribution to the environment here .
so here are some natural fireflies .
i was told that they didn ' t bite , in fact they ' re not even going to leave the glass .
now , there ' s all kinds of game solutions like this , but they don ' t bring much .
we need solutions , either one or several , that have unimaginable scale and unimaginable reliability , and even though there are many directions that people are looking for it , i really see just five who can make these big demands .
i ' ve left tides , geothermals , fusion and biofuels .
these they may do a moderate contribution , and if they do better than i ex expectedpect , that would be great , but my core message here is that we need to work on all these five , and we can ' t give up of them because they intimidate us , because they all have significant problems .
let ' s first look at burning of fossil fuels , burning either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there may seem simple , but it ' s not . you had to capture all the co2 that come out of the chimney after burning ,minat under pressure and then store somewhere and hope it will stay there .
there are some pilot projects that can do this at a 60 percent to 80 percent level , but getting it to 100 percent will going to be very difficult , and getting a settlement to collecting carbon2 is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is storage time issue .
who ' s going to make it ?
who can guarantee something literally hundreds of billions times the size of any kind of waste you can imagine from nuclear and other things ?
that ' s a lot of volume .
so this is a tough deal .
next , nuclear energy .
it also has three big problems . the cost , especially in highly regulated countries , is high . the question of security , that you really feel that nothing can go wrong despite human participation , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it ' s not very big , there ' s a lot of concerns about it .
so three very difficult problems that may be soluble , and so all why you should be work on .
the last three of the five i ' ve summarized .
it ' s renewables , as they ' re often called .
and they also have - even although it ' s great that they don ' t need fuel - they have some badides .
one is that the energy density that these technologies is dramatically lower than power plants .
these are energy farms , you ' re talking about many square kilometers , a thousand times more area than a normal power station .
and also , these sources are interruptions .
the sun doesn ' t shine all day , it doesn ' t shine every day , and so the wind doesn ' t blow all the time .
so , if you depend on these sources , you have to have a way to get the energy in times when it ' s not available .
so there are big price options here . there are challenges in transmission . for example , we say that the energy source is outside the country , not only do they just need the technology , they also have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from somewhere else .
and there ' s the storage problem .
and to show you the dimension , i looked at all sorts of batteries that are being made : the ones for cars , computers , cell phones , flashlights , for everything , and i compared that to the amount of energy the world uses , and i found that all the batteries that we produce now could store less than 10 minutes of the total energy .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something will be by a factor of 100 better than the approaches right now .
that ' s not impossible , but it ' s not that easy .
this is what happens when you try to get these interrupted sources about say , 20 percent to 30 percent of the consumption .
if you want to rely 100 percent on it , you need an incredible miracle battery .
now , where should we go : what ' is s the right approach ?
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the goal ?
what we need are a lot of companies working on this . hundreds .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
many of you will say , they ' re crazy ! that ' s good .
i think in the ted group there are many lot here who are already engaged involved there .
bill klein has several companies , including one called esolar , which has great solarthermal technologies .
vinod khosla invests in dozens of companies that doing great things and have interesting opportunities , and i ' m trying to support that .
nathan myhrvold and i run a company that , perhaps surprisingly , pursue the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the nuclear space : modular , liquid .
the development stopped in this industry a while ago , so it ' s not a big surprise that some good concepts are lying around .
the terrapower concept means that instead of burning a one part of the uranium , the one percent , the u235 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u238 .
that ' s a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you ' d been thinking about this for a long time , but you could never reasonably simulate whether it would work , but since there ' s modern supercomputers , you can simulate it and see that , yes ! with the right materials approach , it looks it works . thinking this
and because you burn those 99 percent , the cost profile is much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use the waste from today ' s reactors as a fuel .
instead of breaking your head over it , you just burn it . it ' s a great thing .
the uranium is gradually useded , a little bit like a candle .
you can see that it ' s a kind of a column , often called as a " traveling wave reactor . "
that really solves the fuel problem .
here ' s a picture of a place in kentucky .
that ' s the waste , the 99 percent . you taken out the part that ' s burned today , so it ' s called contated uranium .
that drove the u . s . for hundreds of years .
and if you filter ocean water cheaply and easily filter , you get enough fuel for the rest of the life of the planet .
you know , there are a lot of challenges , but it ' s an example of lots of hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let ' s think about how we should measure our success .
what should our evidence look like ?
well , let ' s go to the goal that we need to achieve , and then we talk about the intermediate step .
many people talk about 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it ' s really important that we get there .
the other 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still some agriculture , and hopefully forest destruction and cement will be clean until then .
so in order to get that 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like china , have to change their generation of electricity .
the other note is whether we ' re using the zero emissions technology , whether it ' s deployed in all the developed countries , and we ' re on the way to get it to the rest .
that ' s very important .
this becomes a key element of this document .
if we go back from there , what should the 2020 report look like ?
it should contain the two elements again .
we should use the effective measures to get reduction the way , and the less we emi , the lower the co2 sum will be , and therefore the temperature .
but actually fact , this note for the things that we do that don ' t completely lead to the big reductions , just the same , or even a little bit less important than the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
s we have to follow breakthrough with full - gas , and we can measure that in corporate data , in pilot and changes regulation .
there are a lot of great books about on this topic .
the al gore book , " we have a choice , " and david mckay ' s " sustainable energy without the hot air . "
they really go do it through and they create a framework in which this can be discussedly , because we need support from all sides .
there ' s a lot that have to come together .
that ' s a wish .
a very specific wish that we will invent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose that wish , which is , half the energy without co2 is invented . i took that wish .
this one has the biggest effect .
if we don ' t get that wish , the rift between long - term and short - term people will be terrible between the united states and china , between poor and rich countries , and almost all the lives of these two billion will be much worse .
so what do we need to do ? so
what actions am i appeal asking to ?
we need to advocate for more research funds .
when countries meet together in places like paralmines , they shouldn ' t just talk about co2 .
they should discuss this innovation strategy , and they were shocked by the ridiculously little funds spent on these innovative approaches .
we need market incentives , co2 taxes , cap & amp ; trade something that creates a price signal .
we need to spread the message .
we need to have dialogue more rational and more complete and also the things that are done by the government .
it ' s an important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand terrapower a little bit better - of all , can you give us an idea of the scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all the great scientists of what we ' ve done , we only need a few 10 million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure it works reasonably , you ' re only in the 100 million . simulation
the hard step is to build the first reactor , find another billions , the norm and the place that actually build the first of them .
once the first one is done , when it runs as it promised , everything is all clear , because the economy , the energy density , is as different from nuclear energy as we know it .
to get understand that : that means building deep inside the ground almost like a vertical column of nuclear fuel , that expible uranium , and then the process starts up and goes down ?
bg : exactly . today you have to re - fillill the reactor , so there ' s a lot of people and a lot of controls who can go wrong , this thing where you open it up and put things in - or out . that ' s not good .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years - think of a column - that you bury them without all the complexityities .
and it ' s sitting there burning for 60 years , and then it ' s finished .
a nuclear reactor that provides a solution to the waste .
bg : yeah . now , what happens to the garbage : you can let it sit - there ' s a lot less garbage with this method - then you take it and you put it into the next reactor and burn it .
and we start by taking the waste that already exists that ' s in these refrigerators or dry tanks in the reactors . that ' s our launch fuel .
so what was a problem for these reactors is what we fill in our us , and that dramatically reducing the waste volume during this process .
but while you ' re talking to different people in the world about these possibilities .
where ' s the biggest interest in doing this ?
bg : now we haven ' t set on one place yet , and there ' s a lot of interesting rules to everything called the nuclear in name - . there ' s a lot interest , and the people of the company were in russia , india , china - i was here and met the minister of energy and talked about how this fits the energy agency .
i ' m optimistic . you know , the french and the japanese have done something in that direction .
this is a version of something thing that ' s made .
this is an important step forward , but it ' s like a fast reactor , and some countries have built these , so anyone who has implemented a fast reactor is a candidate for our first one .
in your mind , time frame and likelihility really making something like life ?
bg : now we need one of these scalable , electricity - generating things that ' are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to use .
this is sort of the deadline that the environmental models that we need to follow .
and , you know , terrapower , if everything goes well , and that ' s a big wish , it could be easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds that , just if their approaches work , the funding for their pilots work , can it .
and it would be best if several them , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
in terms of the big potential breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing you know ?
bg : a energy breakdown is the most important thing .
it would have been without the environmental funding , but that makes it so more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don ' t know their work as well as this , but there ' s the modular method , which is another approach .
there ' s a liquid reactor type of reactor that seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
and so there are different , but the beauty of this is that an uranium molecule has a million times as much energy as , say , a carbon atom , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems , and they ' re mostly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , the potential , the impact on the country and other things , almost in its own league . an .
if that doesn ' t work , then what do ?
do we need to take emergencys to try to keep the earth ' s temperature stable ?
bg : when you get into this situation , it ' s like you ' ve eating too much and you ' re about to have a heart attack . what do you do ? you might need a heart surgery or something .
there ' s a research field research called geoengineering , which deals at various techniques to delay warming , so that we got 20 or 30 years longer to walk together .
this is just a insurance method .
you hope we don ' t need that .
some people say you shouldn ' t even work on insurance at all , because that might make you lazy , so you keep eating , because you know that ' s going to save you the heart surgery .
i don ' t know if that ' s smart when you consider the importance of this problem , but there ' s now a debate in geoengineering about whether you should have this available if things come faster , or this innovation takes longer than we expect .
climate changeists : do you have one or two sentences for those to maybe convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
do you say there are negative effects have to do with the clouds that move things around ?
there are very , very few things that you can even say , that there is an chance of in a million .
the main problem here is kind of like aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all sorts of urgent problems to invest in something you only have about later - and the other is that the investment isn ' t that clear . in fact , the ipcc report is t necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world looking at ipcc and saying , okay , that ' s not a big drama .
the fact is that this uncertainty should wo us .
but my dream here is that if you can do it economic , and at the same time eliminate remove co2 , the skeptics say , " okay , i don ' t care that it ' s not emi get co2 , i almost wish it would do , but i ' m probably going to accept it because it ' s cheaper than the previous method . "
and that would be their answer to the stefan sagmeister argument that if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals suffer , the poverty reduction , fighting malaria and so on , that it ' s a stupid waste of resources to invest money on it , while there are better things we can do .
bg : well , the actual spending research - let ' say the u . s . should spend 10 billion a year more than they do today - that ' s not that dramatic .
we shouldn ' t suffer other things .
you get to a large amounts of money , and here can reasonable people can disagree if you have something that ' s not economic , and you try to finance that . for me , most of the waste is for me .
unless you ' re very about to a cost collapse and you ' re just funding the learning curve , i think we should try more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
if the balance you get is a very high energy price , then only the rich can compete .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much on our energy without changing their lifestyle .
but for the bottom two billion , it ' s a disaster .
and even stefanborg thinks around .
his new trick is , " why isn ' t the research discussed anymore ? "
he ' s still associated , because , with the skeptic camp , but he ' s understood that this is a very lonely group , and so ' s why he ' s now bringing the research argument .
and this is a thought process that i think is appropriate .
the research , it ' s just crazy how little that ' s supported .
bill , i think i ' speak for almost all people here when i say , i really hope your wish will be true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter skillman introduced a design competition called " the marshmallow challenge . "
the idea is quite simple . four - teams have to build the largest single story structure with 20 spaghetti , about a foot tape , about a foot thread and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
and even though it seems really simple , it ' s actually really hard , because it pushes people to work together very quickly .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design workshop .
it was a huge success .
since then , i ' ve done about 70 workshops the worldwide with students , developers and architects , even with ctos of the fortune 50 companies , and there ' s something about this task that gives you profd insights of the nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of them with you .
usually most people start orient oriented themselves in terms the task .
they ' re talk about it , they ' re think thinking about what it ' s going to look like , they ' re sw screaming around power .
then they spend a little bit time in planning and organization . they sketch and spread spaghetti .
they spend a lot of their time on building growing structures .
and finally , just before you don ' t have time anymore , someone takes the marshmallow and you gently put it gently on the top , step back and , " ta - da ! " admire your work .
but then what , almost always , is that the ta - da becomes a " uh - oh , " because the weight of the marshmallow causes the whole thing to bend swing and collapse .
there are a number of people who have a lot more " uh - oh " moments than others , and among the worst are fresh bwl graduates .
they lie , they cheat , they ' re confused , and they create really poor things .
and of course , there are teams that have a lot more ta - da shapes , and among the best are new from kindergarten .
and that ' s pretty amazing .
as peter told us , not only do they produce the highest towers , but they also produce the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is , how is this happening ? why ? what about them ?
and peter says , " none of the kids spend time the head of spaghetti gmb . "
they don ' t spendvest time in power fights .
but there ' s another reason .
and that is that bwl students were trained to find the right plan , ok !
and then realize it .
then what happens when you put the marshmallow at the top , you don ' t have time anymore , and what happens ?
it ' s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what makes kindergarten kids different is that they start with the marshmallow and building prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so they have the opportunity to repair built prototypes .
designists recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of an incremental process .
and with each trial , the kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn ' t work .
so the performance of working with prototypes is essential - but let ' s see how different teams operate .
the average for most of them is about 50 centimeters , bwl students do half of it , lawyers do a little more , but not much , kindergarten kids are better than adults .
who s most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
. meter is the highest i ' ve seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and - self - reinforcing geometric patterns are the key to building stable structures .
ceos are a little bit over average . but this is where it gets interesting .
if you put an executive administrator on the team , they get significantly better .
it ' s incredible . you look around and you realize , " this team will win . "
you can predict that . why is this happening ?
because they have special skills for process coordinateing .
they lead the process , they understand it .
and that team that controlss and respects to the work will dramatica significantly improve the performance the team .
specialized skills and process skills and their combination lead to success .
if you have 10 teams that typical do , you get about six that have stable structures .
now i tried something interesting .
i thought , let ' s do the poker training .
so i offered a 1 , 000 dollar prize of software for the winners .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anybody had built a two - inch construction , they would have carried the price home .
so isn ' t it interesting that high competition have a strong effect ?
we repeated that exercise with the same students .
so what do you think happened ?
now they understood the benefits of prototyping .
so the same , bad team became one of the best .
they produced the highest construction in all time .
so there are deepound lessons for us about the nature of drive and success .
you might ask , why would someone actually spend time creating a marshmallow challenge ?
the reason is i create digital tools and processes to help teams create cars , video games and visual effects .
and what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps identify hidden assumptions .
because frankly , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , or basic motiv , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this such simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in can visit marshmallow tour . com .
it ' s a blog where you see how to build the marshmallows .
there ' s a step - by - step instructions there .
you find crazy examples from all over the world of how people optimizing and reffineiningng the system .
there are also world records .
and the basal lesson , i think , is that construction is actually a connect sport .
it requires that we all focus our senses on the task , and that we optimal use our thinkingly , how our feelings and our doing , in the challenge that we face .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all it takes to take us from a " uh - oh " - to a " ta - da " moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
let ' s pretend we have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool ted - like machine , and this is a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to go in .
and you can go to the past ; , you can go to into the future ; you can ' t stay in the present and now .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i ' ve often asked my friends that question lately , and they all wanted to go back to the past .
i don ' t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there were cars or twitter , or " america ' s seeking the superstar . "
i don ' t know .
i ' m convinced that some you ' re kind of drawn to nostalgia , to wish .
and that ' s what i understand .
i ' m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don ' t want to go to the past , and it ' s not because i ' m an adventurer .
it ' s because the pos opportunities on this planet don ' t go back , they ' re going forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that ' s ever been on the planet , no matter what scale they ' re : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining disease rates .
there was never been a time like this before .
my great - grandparents all died when they were 60 .
my grandparents pushed that number to 70 .
my parents are 80 on the foot .
so there should better be a nine at the beginning of my death .
but it ' s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . that ' s an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
they ve reigne transformed the population of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
they ' re gone . they ' ve gone .
we fought them . boomop .
in the rich world , diseases that have still threat threatened millions of us just a generation ago , barely exist .
diphery , redlines , child mortality .
does anyone else know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are successes of the scientific method .
and in my view , the scientific way to try things is to see if it works , change it if it doesn ' t , is one of humanity ' s greatest achievements .
so that ' s the good news .
unfortunately , that ' s the good news , because there are a few other problems , and they ' ve been mentioned a lot .
and one of them is that despite all our achievements , a billion people in the world go to bed hungry every day .
this number rises , and it goes up very quickly , and that ' s emrassing .
and not only that , we ' ve used our imagination to deeplyly devapress this world .
drinking water , arable land , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappearing , and soon , and if we don ' t get out of this chaos - we disappeares .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think we can .
i think it ' s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without raping the country they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn ' t destroy it at the same time .
i really believe that , and no , that ' s not a wish dream .
but this keeps me up at night - one of the things that keeps me up at night - we ' ve never needed scientific progress as now , never yet .
and we ' ve never been able to use it reasonably the as we can today .
we ' re on the verge of too amazing , amazing events in many areas , and yet i really think that we had to go back hundreds , 300 years before enlightenment to find a time when we ' ve fought progress where we ' ve been these things more on more fronts than we are now . now . we .
people confine themselves in their faith , so tight that you can ' t libera freete them .
not even the truth will liberate you them .
and listen , everybody has a right to their opinion ; even a right to their opinion to progress .
but you know what you ' re not a right about with ?
they have no right to their own facts . ' they don ' t have gui sorry .
and it took me a while to figure out .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccines for the new yorker , a little article .
and i was amazed to face resistance , to resistance to what is ultimately the most effective act in health care in human history .
i didn ' t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote an article and went on .
and soon after that , i wrote an article on genetically engineered foods .
same thing , just bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i also wrote an article about it , and i couldn ' t understand why people thought it was " green food , " why they believed thought that molecules were pushing around in a particular way rather than a random way was an pest to the field of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept on .
i mean , i ' m a journalist .
we type , we give in , we to eat , that ' s okay .
but these articles were worried about , and i couldn ' t figure out why , and eventually i found out .
and that ' s because these fanatics who made me crazy weren ' t fanatics at all .
these were careful people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that got me so crazy .
but then i thought , you know what , let ' s face it .
we ' re at a point where we don ' t have the same relationship with progress as we used to be .
we ' re talk about it .
we talk ironically about it with little quotes about it : " progress . "
okay , there are reasons for that , and i think we know what reasons that are .
we have lost trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and there ' s no reason why it should ' t be that way .
you can just name some names , and people will ll understand .
chernobyl , bhutan , the challenger , vioxx , weapons of mass destruction , the 2000 u . s . presidential election .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people that we thought were always right . so be skeptical .
ask questions , ask evidence , ask evidence .
take nothing as granted .
but here ' s the thing : if you get evidence , you have to take adopt that evidence , and we ' re not good at that .
and i can say that we now living in an epidemic of fear that i ' ve never seen and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that associated the autism epidemic with measles , mumps and redfish vaccine .
very scarghty .
lots of studies have been conducted to see if that was true .
lots of studies should be conducted ; that ' s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the u . s . , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no .
it doesn ' t make any difference . it doesn ' t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what causes us to feel real .
we don ' t believe in a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of this was catastrophic .
catastrophic because of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where vaccine for measles are declining .
this is scandal , and we should be ashamed .
it ' s terrible .
what happened we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because anybody have measles here ? because ?
a single person in the audience ever seen anyone die of measles ?
it doesn ' t happen very often .
doesn ' t happen in this country at all , but 160 , 000 times in the world last year .
that ' s a lot of deaths from measles , 20 per hour .
but because that has ' t happened here , we can eliminate it , and people like jenny mccarthy can walk around and preach messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like oprah and larry king live .
and you can do that because they don ' t link cause and correlation .
they don ' t understand that these things seem to the same , but they ' almost never the same thing .
and this is something we need to learn , and very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he liberated us from one of humanity ' s worst scourgings .
no fear , no fear , child mortality , poff , gone .
the guy in the middle doesn ' t do that much .
he ' s called paul offit .
he has just developed a rotavirus vaccine with some few other people .
it can save the lives of 400 , 500 , 000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn ' t it ?
now , that ' s good , besides paul walking around and talking about vaccines and saying how valuable they are and that people should just stop gring .
and he actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist . so
when paul speaks in a public interrogation , he can ' t say without armed guards .
he gets phone calls at home because people like to tell him they know where his kids go to school .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
i don ' t need to say that , but vaccines are essential .
if you follow them , the diseases come back , terrible diseases , and that ' s happening .
we ' ve have meas in this country .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon kids will die of it , because that ' s just a matter of numbers .
and they ' re not just going to die of measles .
what about childate ? let ' s take that . why not ?
a classmate of mine wrote me a few weeks ago and said she think i ' m a little too smart .
no one ' s ever said that before .
she wouldn ' tcciject her child against child mortality . absolutely not .
fine .
why ? because we don ' t have child mortality . and you know what ?
we didn ' t have childo this yesterday .
today , i don ' t know , maybe this morning , somebody in lagos got on an and was just going to los angeles , right now he ' s over ohio .
and in a few hours , he ends up and rents a car , and he s comes to long beach , and he ' s going to visit one of these fantastic ted dinner tonight .
and he doesn ' t know that he ' s infected with a paralyzing disease , and we don ' t know either , because that ' s how the world works .
this is the planet that we live on . don ' t pretend it ' s not .
we love to lie ourselves in lies . we love that .
did you all your vitamins this morning ?
aphiainaceas , a little antioxidant that helps them .
i know they did that because half of americans do this every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cures , and it doesn ' t matter how often we find out that they ' re useless .
the data proves this all the time .
they dimotte their urine . they almost never do more .
that ' s okay , you ' want like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand - we hate the pharmaceutical industry .
we hate a too strong government . we have no trust in the system .
and we shouldn ' t . our healthcare system is bad .
it ' s cruel to millions of people .
it ' s absolutely amazingprisly cold and soul - bloody even to us who can afford it .
so we walk away off of it , and where are we going ?
we ' re going into the arms of the placebo industry .
that ' s great . i love the placebo industry .
but you know , this ' s really a serious issue , because this stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
and i have all kinds of little props here .
none of these - goko , fraud , euinac , fraud , acai , i don ' t even know what that is , but we spend billions of dollars on it , it ' s fraud .
and you know what ? when i say that , people scream at me and say , " what do you care ? let people do what they want .
this is how you feel good . "
and you know what ? you ' re wrong .
because i don ' t care whether it ' s the minister of health who says , " well , i ' m not going to accept take the evidence of my experts on mammography , " or some cancer geecope who wants to treat his patients with coffee cakets .
when you go this path where faith and magic replace evidence and replace science , you get to a place where you they don ' t want to be .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
he killed 400 , 000 of his people because he insisted that red tomatoes , mustaley and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know can slow the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country worse than any other else is scared by this disease .
don ' t tell me that these things don have consequences .
they have them . they always have them .
now , the most brainless epidemic that we ' re in right now is this ridicuurds struggle between the advocates of genetically engineered food and the bio elite .
this is an idiot debate . it has to stop .
it ' s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every grain of rice , every branch of broli , every rosebush , has was changed by people .
you know , there were no mandarins in the paradise .
there were no cantaloupe flowerss .
there were no christmas trees . we did all this .
we ' ve been doing it in the last 11 , 000 years .
and some of them worked and some of it didn ' t work .
we got out rid of it what didn ' t work .
now we can do it more closer , and of course there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and that this stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , extend their lives .
you don ' t you want to do that ? .
i have to say , i don ' t understand that .
we disb genetically engineered food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i hear all the time is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monopoliics , we don ' t want huge fields with one , that ' s wrong .
we don ' t want companies to patent life .
we don ' t want companies to own seeds .
and you know what my answer to all of this is ?
yes , you ' re right . let ' s fix that .
it ' s true , we have a huge food problem , but that ' s not science .
that has nothing to do with science .
it ' s right , morality , patent stuff .
you know science isn is not a company .
it ' s not a country .
it ' s not even an idea ; it ' s a process .
it ' s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn ' t , but the idea that we shouldn ' t allow science to do its work because we ' re afraid is a real dead end , and it keeps millions of people from flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we ' ll have to grow 70 percent more grow more food than we are right now . 70 percent .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
shamebarrassing . shamesing .
they need that , and we don ' t give it them .
and why ? genetically engineered food .
we don ' t want to encourage people to eat this rot stuff , like maniouoc .
maniok is something thats for half a billion people .
it ' s kind of like a potato .
it ' s just a bunch of calories . it ' s bad .
it doesn ' t no nutrients , it doesn ' t have protein , and scientists are building all this in it right now .
and then people could eat that and wouldn ' t get blind .
they wouldn ' t starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn ' t be chez panisse , but it would be beautiful .
and all i can say about this is : why do we fight this ?
i mean , let ' s ask ourselves , why do we fight this ?
because don ' t want to moveize genes around ?
it ' s not about pushing genes around . it ' s not about chemicals .
it ' s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our insistiistence on greater food , better food , unique food .
it ' s not about rice krispies ; it ' s about keeping people alive , and it ' s time to understand what that means .
because you know what ? because
if we don ' t do that , if we keep going as we do , we desewe of something i think we don ' t want to be guilty about , high - tech colonialism .
there ' s no other description of what ' s happening here .
it ' s selfish , it ' s ugly , it ' s not worthy , and we really have to stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , " do you still want to go into this ridiculous time machine and into the future ? "
definit anyway . i certainly want to do that .
right now it ' s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time machine on anything we want .
we can move them where we want to move them around , and we ' re going to move them where we want to go .
we have to have these conversations , and we have to think about it , but if we get into the time machine and go into the future , we ' re going to be happy to have done that .
i know we can , and as far as i am me , that ' s something the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for a while , i ' ve been interested in the placebo effect . it may seem strange that a magician is interested in this , unless you look at it like me as " a deception that becomes real when somebody believes strong enough in it . "
in other words , sugar pills in some studies have shown a measurable effect some , the placebo effect , and just because the person thinks what happens to them is a pharmaceutical or a kind of - in pain management , for example , if the patient believess strong enough in it , there ' s a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect .
a deception becomes something real , because someone perceives it that way .
so order for us to understand each other , i want to show you now a fundamental , very simple magic trick .
and i ' m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that ' s been at least in every magic book for kids since the 1950s .
i myself learned it from the cub scout magic of the road in the 1970s .
i ' m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i ' m going to explain why i explain it .
so , see what happens .
the knife you can study ; my hand you can study .
i ' m just to hold the knife in my fis .
i put my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing disappe in my sleeve or comes out of it , i ' m just going to pusheze my wrist right here .
in this way you can see that anything moves at no time , as long as i express here , nothing can go in my sleeve or come out .
and the goal here is very simple .
i ' m going to open my hand , and hopefully if everything goes well , the knife is held by my mere physical magnetism .
it ' s actually sitting so hard in its place that i can shake it without the knife falling down .
nothing goes in my sleeve or comes out , not a trickster , and you can study everything .
ta - da !
now , this is a trick that i often teach little kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception when you look closely , even though it ' s a very simple performing trick .
probably many of you in this room probably know this trick .
it is how it works .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i ' m saying that i wrapped my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or comes out , and that ' s a lie .
the reason i hold my wrist is because there ' s the real secret of illusion .
because the moment i turn my hand away from you , so you can see it from behind , this finger here , my finger , just moves from where it was , into a position where it ' s so extended .
great trick ?
there ' is somebody there back who didn ' t have childhood .
so , he ' s here . right .
and when i turn around , the finger changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don ' t realize that there are only three fingers down here : because the mind and the way he processes information don ' t count it one , one , two , three , but see them as a group .
but that ' s not actually what this about now . and then i open my hand .
of course , it ' s held there , but not through the magnetism of my body , but through a trick through my finger , which ' s there now .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by i turning back , is hidden by this movement , that the finger moves back .
i take this hand away . and here ' s the knife .
you can do trick to your friends and your neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ?
a year ago or so , i read a study that really blew my mind .
i ' m not a doctor or a researcher , and that ' s why this was an amazing thing for me .
because what turns out is that if you offer a placebo in the form of a white pill , in the form of an a pill , it ' s just a round white pill that has a certain measurable effect .
but if you change the shape in which you give placebo , for example , into a smaller pill , and you shape that blue color and a letter on it , it ' s actually more measurable more effective .
and this , although none of them are any pharmaceutical - they ' re just sugar pills .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really made me freak out .
but it turns out that ' s not all .
if you take capsules , they ' re even more effective than pills of any form .
a colored capsule , which is yellow at and the other red , is better than a white capsule .
dose also important .
one pill twice a day is not as good as three pills - i can ' t remember the exact statisticsstic now . i ' m sorry .
but the key thing is , .
. that the doses also play matter .
and the shape matters .
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to reach to the needle .
right ? a syringe with has an inective - a few milligrams of a ineffective substance that you inject in a patient .
this creates a very strong picture in the head . it ' s much stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really - i ' ll show you another time we have a projector .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn ' t work as well as the blue pill , which doesn ' t work as well as a capsle that doesn ' t work as well as the needle .
and none of this has any really pharmaceutical property . it ' s just our belief in it that ' s making a stronger impact in us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i take something that ' s obviously a deception and make it look real .
we know from this study that you have to reach the needle when it comes to it .
this is an 18 - inch hat needle . it ' s very , very sharp , and i ' m going to first initile it a little bit first .
this is really my meat . it ' s not damian ' s special grown meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
now i ' m going to put this needle in my skin and carry it through it until it comes out on the other side .
if you get evil - if you easily aslzed - i showed this to a couple of friends in the hotel room last night , and some people i didn ' t know , and a woman has almost paralyzed .
so i propose , if you get , look away for the next 30 seconds , or , you know , i ' m going to do the first sticky part back here .
you can see it in a moment , but you can also look away if you want to .
so , it goes like this , right here where my meat starts , at the bottom part of my arm i ' m going to make a little sl in .
i ' m really sorry . is you doing crazy ? . ?
and now just get out a little bit out of my skin and on the other side .
now we ' re actually in the same situation that we had in the knife .
about .
but now you can ' t count my fingers , right ? . but
so i ' m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when they see that .
they say , " okay , he ' s certainly not that stupid and he ' s to scratch your skin just to talk to us for a few minutes . "
well , i ' ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people in the back say , " okay . i didn ' t see that right . "
the people in the back room are coming in .
let me show you from nearbyness .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
that ' s my meat , and i can turn that around .
i ' m sorry . if you get bad , look away , don ' t look .
the people in the back , or the people who see this at some point on video later will say , " well , this looks pretty impressive , but if it was real , it would be - you see , there ' s a hole , and there , if it was really real , it would be bloomed . "
okay , so let me sque out a little blood for you .
yes , here it is .
i would take out the needle now .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think , in this frame here , and purpose to make something real out of a deception , i ' m just going to leave the needle in there and go off of the stage .
we ' re going to meet a few more times in the next few days .
i hope you ' re looking forward to it . thank you very much .
everybody talking about happiness days .
i had some people count the number of books that were published with " happiness " in title in the last five years , and they gave up after about 40 years , and there ' s a lot more .
there ' s a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there ' s a lot of happiness coaching .
everybody ' d like to make people happier .
but despite all this flood of work , there are several cognitive cases that make it almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today will mostly about these cognitive cases .
this is true of amateurs who think about their own happiness , and it ' s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we ' re just as confused as everyone else .
the first of these cases is a contra to admitting complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is just no longer a useful word , because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there ' s a certain meaning that we might limit it to , but by and large , that ' s something that we ' re need to give up , and we ' re going to have to take the complicated view of what well - being is .
the second case is a confusion of experience and memory : basically between being happy in his life and being happy about his life or being happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they ' re both thrown put together in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the concentration illusion , and that ' s the unfortunate fact that we can ' t think about a fact that affects well - being without distorting its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive case .
there ' s just no way to get it right .
now , i ' d like to start with an example of someone who had a question and answer session after one of my lectures that who told a story . [ unclear . ] he said he had heard a symphony , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and at the very end of the shot there was a terrible sound .
and then he added , really quite emotionally , that ruined the whole experience .
but it didn ' t have that .
what it had ruined it was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of beautiful music .
they didn ' t pay because he had fallen stuck with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had gotten to keep .
what this really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and about other people in the sense of two types of self .
there ' s an experienced self that lives in the present and knows the present , is able to per experience the past , but basically only the present .
it ' s the experienceng self that the doctor calls - you know , when the doctor asks , " does it hurt if i put it here ? "
and then there ' s an remember self , and the remember self is the one that and sus keeps the story of our lives , and it ' s the one the doctor offers by asking the question , " how have you felt lately ? "
or , " what was your journey to albania ? " or something like that .
these are two very different units , the experienceent self and the remi self , and confusing the two is part of the mess of the notion of happiness .
now , the remember self is a storyteller .
and this that it really starts with a fundamental response to our memories - it starts immediately .
we don ' t just tell stories when we set to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which is what we can keep from our experiences is a story .
and let me start with an example .
there ' s an old study .
these are real patients undering a painful procedure .
i ' m not going to go into the details of it . it ' s not longer painful anymore , but it was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report about their pain every 60 seconds .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they ' re asked , " who these has suffered more ? "
and that ' s a very simple question .
patient b clearly suffered more . his gut vision was longer , and every minute of pain patient a had patient b , and more .
but now there ' s another question : " how much did these patients think they were suffering ? "
and here ' s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of gut vision than patient b .
the stories of gut imaging were different , and because a very important part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories are very cher or great - but one of them is clear .
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and the one who was the worse was where the pain was at the very end at its peak . it ' s a bad story .
how do we know ?
because we asked these people about their gut radiation , and much later , " how bad was the whole thing overall ? "
and it was much worse for a than b in memory .
now , this is a direct conflict between the experienced self and the remember self .
from the perspective of the experienceder ' self , b clearly had a worse time .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we ' ve actually done clinical experiments , and it ' s been done , and it works , you could actually extend the gut vision of patient a by just putting the tube in there without slipting too much on it .
that ' s going to cause the patient to suffer , but only a little and much less than it did before .
and if you do this for a few minutes , you ' ve done that patient ' s experience self patient a is worse off , and you ' ve done patient the memory self of patient a be much better off , because now you ' ve given patient a better story about his experience .
what does a story ?
and that ' s true of the stories memory gives us , and it ' s true of the stories that we invent .
what a story is changes , significant moments and ends .
end are very , very important , and in this case , dominatedted the end dominated .
well , the experience self lives his life continuously .
it has moments of experience , one after another .
and they say , what happens to those moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they ' re lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our lives - and i calculated that - you know , the psychological present is be about three seconds long . which means , you know , there are about 600 million of them in a life . a month , there are about 600 , 000 . most of them don ' t leave no trace .
most of you are completely ignored by the remi self .
and yet , you kind of get the sense that you should count , that what happened during those these moments of experience is our lives .
it ' s the limited resource we use while we ' re in this world .
and how we usee them would seem be important , but that ' s not the story that keeps the remi self for us .
so we have the remiing self and the experience self , and they ' re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is dealing with time .
from the perspective of the experienceder self , if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first week , the two - week vacation is twice as good as the one - vacation .
that ' s not how it doesn ' works work for the remember self at all .
for the remi self , a two - week vacation is hardly better than one - week vacation because there are s no new memories it .
they didn ' t changed the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes an remi self from an experienced self . time has very little impact on this story .
now , the remember self does more than remembering and telling stories .
it ' s actually the one that who makes decisions , because if you have a patient who has , say , two gut imaging with two different surgeons and decides which to choose , the one who chooses is the one who has the memory , that who ' s less bad , and that ' s the surgeon who ' s to chosen . , . , . you .
the experienced self has no voice in that choice .
actually , we don ' t choose between experiences . we choose between memories experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we don ' t usually think about our future as experiences .
we think about our future as fore memories .
and basically , you can think of this , you know , as a tyranny of the remember self , and you can think of the remembering self as one that kind of drags the experienceer self through experiences the experienceer self doesn ' t need .
i feel that when we take vacation , that ' s very often the case , which is , we do have vacation largely in the service of the remember self .
and that ' s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we suffer from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that ' given for the dominance of the remi self .
and when i think about it , i think about a vacation we had a couple years ago in antarctica a , which was clearly the best vacation i ' d ever had , and i think quite often about it in relation to how often i think about other vacations .
and i ' ve probably benefitd from my memories of this three - week journey , i would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had ever opened the folder with the 600 images in it i would have spent another an hour .
now , that ' s three weeks , and that ' s only a hour and a half .
there seems to be a disco .
now , i may be a little bit extreme , you know , in how little appeti i have on about reading memories , but even if you do more of it , there ' s a real question . why do we give memories so much weight in to the weight we give experiences ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next vacation , you know that at the end of the vacation , all of your images are being destroyed out , and you get an amnesiac drug so you won ' t remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you chose a different vacation , there ' s a conflict between your two kinds of self , and you have to think about how you decide this conflict , and that ' s really not obvious at all , because if you think in the sense of time , you get an answer , and if you think in the sense of memories , you might get a different answer .
why we choose the vacation that we choose is a problem that we face with a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two types of self throw two words of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the experienceder self ?
and then you would ask , how happy are the moments in the experienceder ' self life ?
and they ' re all - happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and by the way , we ' re now able to get a pretty good idea of the experienceder ' s happiness over time .
when you ask about the happiness of the remember self , it ' s a very different thing .
this is not how happy a person lives .
it ' s about how happy or delightd the person is when that person think about their lives .
very different term .
anyone who doesn ' t separate those terms will screw up the exploration of happiness , and i ' m part of a lot of researchers of well - being who have longrewed up the exploration of happiness time in that way .
the distinction between the of the experienced s self happiness and the happiness ofing self has been recognized in the last few years , and now you ' re trying to measure the two separately .
the gallup organization has a worldwide survey where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in that direction .
so in the last few years , we ' ve started learning about the happiness of both kinds of self .
and the main lesson that i think we ' ve learned is that they ' re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with their life , and that doesn ' t really teach them much about how happy they lives their life and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of correlation , correlation is about . 5 .
what that means is that if you were met someone and you would told tell them , oh , his father is a two - foot man , how much would you know about his height ?
well , you ' d know something about his greatness , but there ' s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much insecuty .
when i tell you that someone classified their life as eight on a scale of 10 , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they is with their experienceder self .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about something that determines the happiness of the happiness itself .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness mostly means being happy with people we like , spending time with people we like .
there are other pleasures , but that ' s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of two types of self , you ' re going to end up doing very different things .
the conclusion line from what i ' ve said here is that we reallyn ' really think happiness as a substitute for well - being .
it ' s a completely different term .
now , very briefly , another reason we can ' t really think about happiness is that we don ' t pay attention to the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are , you ' re not going to get the right correct answer .
when you ask this question , you think people in california have to be happier when they live , say , in ohio .
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate isn ' t very important for to the experienced self , and it ' s not even very important for the thoughtful self that decides how happy people are .
now , because the thoughtful self is responsible , you can end up - some people could end up moving to california .
and it ' s kind of interesting to follow what happens to people who moving to california hoping to get happier .
now , your experience self will not get happier .
we know that .
but one thing ' s going to happen . you ' re think you ' re happier , because when you think about it , you ' re going to be reminded of how awful the weather was in ohio , and you ' ll feel that you ' ve made the right decision .
it ' s very hard to think about well - being concrete clearly , and i hope i ' ve given you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we talked a couple of weeks ago , they mentioned to me that there was a pretty interesting result that came from this gallup survey .
is this something you can share us , because you have a few minutes left now ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
i think the most interesting result we found in the gallup survey is a number we absolutely didn ' t ex expected to find .
we found that in terms of the happiness of the experienceder .
if we looked at how feelings vary with income .
and it turns out that under a income of 60 , 000 dollars a year , for americans , and that ' s a very large sample of americans , about 600 , 000 , but it ' s a large representative sample , under a income of 600 , 000 dollars a year .
60 , 000 .
dk : 60 , 000 .
60 , 000 dollars a year people are unhappy , and they get less unhappy as poorer they get .
over that , we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean , i ' ve rarely seen such flat lines .
what happens is obvious that money doesn ' t give you experience happiness , but scarcity of money certainly you misery , and we can measure that misery very , very clearly .
in the sense of the other self , the remembering self , you get a different story .
the more money you make , the more happy you are .
that ' s not emotions .
but danny , the entire american pursuit is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people took this finding seriously , i mean , it seems to turn everything on its head , everything we believe , for example , in terms of tax policy and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country , would generally take a finding like this seriously and politics based on ?
dk : you know , i think there ' s recognition for the role of happiness research in politics .
the recognition will slowly be in the united states , no question , but in the united . k . it ' s happening now , and in other countries it ' s happening right .
people are about to acknowledzingge that they should think about happiness when they think about politics .
it ' s going to take a while , and people will going discuss whether they want to study experience happiness or whether they want to study life assessment , so we need to have this discussion pretty soon .
how to increase happiness goes very differently on how you think , and whether you think about the remember self , or whether you think about the experienceer self .
this is going to change , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , they ' re set out to measure the experience happiness of the population .
this will , i think , be part of national statistics in the next or two .
now , it seems to me that this topic going to be , or should at least the most interesting political debate to pursue over the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny kahneman .
i ' m jane mcgonigal . i create computer games .
i ' ve been developing online games for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality as it is saving in online games .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including all of you , to spend more time playing bigger and great games .
we currently spend three billion hours a week playing online play .
some of you may think , " that ' s a lot of time for games . "
maybe a little too much time if you think about how many problems we desperate to solve in the real world .
but in fact , according to my research at the institute for the future , the exact opposite is exactly true .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solve the ' s urng desperate problems .
in fact , i am convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that time dramatically .
i calculated that the time it takes 21 billion hours of play per week .
now this may seem a little bit unial , so i ' ll repeat it so that it can work : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think we need to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the next decade .
no , i ' m really serious .
why ? this picture pretty precise describes why i think games are so essential for the survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of photographer phil toledano .
he wanted to capture the feelings of playing , so he set up a camera front of the players .
this is one of the classic expressions in play .
if you ' re not a player , some of the nuances are missing in this picture .
you ' probably see this sense of urgency , a bit of fear , but also very focus , very deeped in solving a really difficult problem .
if you play , you can see some nuances here , the eyesward and the mouth are a sign of optimism . the eyebrows are surprised .
this is a player on the edge of what ' s called epic victory .
oh , you know this . ok . great . so we have some players here .
an epic victory is a result so extremely positive that they didn ' t even know before that it was possible at .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and when you do it , you ' re shocked that you ' re actually capable of do . that ' s an epic victory .
this player is about to an epic victory .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces of problem solvers around the world as we re tackle the barriers of the next century , the face of those who standing facing all odds on the edge of an epic victory .
well , unfortunately , we see this face more in real life when we face difficult problems .
i call it the " i ' m bad in life " face , and it ' s actually my face , you see ? yeah ? ok .
that ' s me as i do the " life i ' m bad in life " face .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph . d . why we are better in games than in real life .
this ' s a problem that a lot of players have .
we think we ' re not as good in reality as we are in games .
and i ' m not i being less successful , even though this belongs part .
we ' re more in game worlds . i mean good motivation to do something significant , inspired to working with each other .
if we ' re in a game world , i think many of us turn into our best version , anytime and immediately helpful , pers try to solve the problem as long as need , try it after failure .
and in reality , when we fail , when we encounter obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or cynical .
we never have those feelings when we play games , ; they just don ' t exist in games .
and that ' s what i wanted to study as a ph . student .
why is it impossible games to think that you couldn ' t just do anything ?
how can we transferlate these feelings from games into reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft which provides the ideal environment for collaborative problem solving .
and i ' ve discovered a number some things that make epic victories in online worlds so possible .
so , first of all , when you enter into one of these online games , especially in world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters who are willing to trust you a world - wide mission , immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly with your current level in the game , right ? but ?
so you can do that .
you never get a problem that you can ' t solve .
but always at the edge of your capabilities , so you have to struggle . but there ' s no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you don ' t sitting around you ' re turning thumb . there ' s always specifically to do something important .
and there are lots of employees .
wherever they go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to finish their epic mission .
we don ' t do have do that in real life , this feeling that button , there are bunch of employees ready .
also there ' s this epic story , this inspiring story of why we ' re there and what we have to do .
then we get all this positive feedback .
you ' ve probably heard about " level high " and " plus - one strength " or " plus - one intelligence . "
that constant feedback is not in real life .
when i leave that stage , i don ' t have : plus one and plus one crazy idea , plus 20 crazy idea .
i can don ' t get that feedback in real life .
so , the problem of cooperation online worlds like world of warcraft is that it ' s so satisfying to be on the edge of an epic victory any time that we prefer rather to spend all our time in these game worlds .
they ' re just better than reality .
to this day , all world of warcraft players have spent 5 . 93 million years solving the virtual problems of azeroth .
that ' s not necessarily something bad thing .
it may sound bad .
but to put it in context , 5 . 93 million years ago , our first primate ancestors began started walking upright .
so the first up primate .
ok , so when we talk about how much time we ' re spending playing games right now , it just makes sense when you look at time in of the scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also appropriate , because it turns out that by using on play all time we ' re actually changing what we can do as humans .
we grow into collaborative thinking , dear creatures .
that ' s the truth . i believe that .
look at this interesting statistic was recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university : the average young person today in a country with strong play culture spends 10 , 000 hours playing online play through the 21st age of age .
so , 10 , 000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , 10 , 080 hours is the exact time they spend in school from fifth grade to graduation of high school - if you ' re never missing .
so here we have a complete parallel education path , where young people learn learning the what it means to be a good player , just like everything else they learn in school .
and maybe some of you have read the new book by malcolm gladwell , " hyperfler . "
so you know his theory of success , the theory of success over 10 , 000 hours .
it ' s based on the great research in cognitive science that if we spend 10 , 000 hours trying to studying any subject to the 21st years , we become masters in it .
we become becoming as good at doing whatever it is as the most important people in the world .
so , what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are master players .
so the big question is , " what are players excellent at ? "
because if we could figure that out , we had basically unprecedented human potential available before .
so many people we have in the world now who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
these are our masters . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at " something . "
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are extraordinarily good at whatever .
if you haven ' t heard it .
the game industry is developing games that save energy and work on mobile phone networks , rather than the broadband internet , so that players can play online over the world , especially in india , china , brazil .
you expect an another billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1 . 5 billion players in total .
so i started thinking about what it is that these games make us masters with .
here are the four things i found . first of all , urgency optimism .
ok , think of it as extreme self - motivation .
urgency optimism is the desire to do something immediately , to overcome a barrier , along with the belief that we have a reasonable hope for success .
playersrs always believe that an epic victory is possible , and that it ' s always worth trying , and the same .
players don ' t sit around .
gamers are masters of spinning dense social nets .
there ' s a lot of interesting research that show that we like people more after we ' ve playing with them , even if they ' ve beat us evil .
the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play somebody a game with .
we trust that somebody spend time with us , that the rules are held , that we have the same goal and we stay until the play .
so interaction allows the growing of ties , trust and each other .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
happy productivity . fantastic .
you know , there ' s a reason why the average word of warcraft player plays 22 hours a week , sort of a part - time job .
the reason is that when we play , we ' re actually happier to work hard than when we relax or do nothing .
we know that as human beings , we optimally when we do hard , important work .
and players are always willing to work hard when they get the right task .
and finally , epic meaning .
playersrs love to become part of awe on planetary scale .
here ' s a background to put this in the right perspective . you certainly all know wikipedia , the world ' s largest wiki .
the second largest wiki in the world , with almost 80 , 000 entries , is the world of warcraft wiki .
five million people use it every month .
they collected more information about world of warcraft on the internet than they did about any other topic in any other wiki in the world .
they create an epic story .
they create an epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single outcome . players are super - powerful , hopeful individuals .
they ' re s people who believe that as individuals they can change the world as individuals .
and the only problem is that they think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real worlds .
that ' s the problem i ' m trying to solve .
edward castronova is a folk scientist .
his work is brilliant . he explores why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds .
and he says , " we ' re going to witnessing nothing less than a mass augmentationration into virtual worlds and online game environments . "
and this is from an economist . so he ' s logical .
and he says .
not like me - i develop games , i ' m a little overpowertable .
so he says this actually makes sense , because players can do more in online worlds than they in real life .
you can make stronger social ties in games than in real life . you get more feedback and rewards in games than you in real life .
so , he says it ' s completely logical right now that players spend more time in the virtual world than they spend in the real world .
i agree , that ' s logical .
but it ' s definitely not an optimal situation .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event back 2 , 500 years ago .
there are these ancient cubes , made out of sheep ' s bones . you know ?
before these fantastic game controllers , there were sheep ' s skulls .
and these were , of the first developed game .
and if you ' re familiar with the works of the old greek historian herodotus , you may know this story , the story of how and why games were invented .
according to herodotus , games , specifically cube games , were invented in the kingdom of lydia during a famine .
itly there was such a great famine that the king of lydia decided to a crazy idea .
people suffered . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so , according to herodot , they invented the cube game , and they agreed a national strategy . one day you would eat food . the next day you would play .
and they would be so immersed in the cube game , because games are so fascinating and surrounded us with satisfying , happy productivity , that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to herodot , they survived this famine for 18 years by eating one day and playing the next day .
just like , i think we ' re using games today .
we use games to escape the suffering of the real world .
we use games to avoid everything that doesn ' t work in the real world , everything that isn ' not satisfying in real life , and we get what we need out of games .
but that doesn ' t have to be the end .
that ' s the exciting thing .
according to herodot , after 18 years , famine did not get better , so the king decided to perform a last cube game .
they divided the kingdom into two halves .
they played a cube game , and the winners got to break into an epic adventure .
they left libya and they went looking for a new home , and they were just leaving as many people as there was food to survive , and looking for with the rest for an area where they could thourrive in .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but recent dna evidence shows that the macedonians , who later became the roman empire , have the same dna as the old libya .
so scientists recently came to realized that herodotus ' crazy story is actually true .
and geologists found evidence of a global cooling that took almost 20 years , which could explain famine .
so this crazy story could true .
maybe they actually saveded their people through play by lett into games for 18 years and then having that intuit and learning so much about how playing each other that they saved the entire civilization .
so , we can too .
we ' ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
this was the first strategy game in real time game in the world of warcraft series . this was 16 years ago .
they ' ve played cube games for 18 years and we ' ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
i ' m argue we ' re ready for our own epic game .
so , they sent half of their civilization looking for a new world , so i ' ll take my 21 billion games a week .
we should agree that half of us spend an hour a day playing until we solved the real world ' s problems .
i know you ' re going to ask , " how do we solve the problems of the real world in games ? " and that ' s exactly what i ' ve devoted my work at the institute for the future .
we have this flag in our office in palo alto , it expressinges how we should understand the future .
we don ' t want to try to tell the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best outcome , and then empower people to implement that idea into reality .
we imagine epic victories and we give people the opportunity to reach them .
i ' m going to show you a briefly three games that i ' i designed to try and give people epic victories in their own future .
this is " world without oil . "
the game is from 2007 .
it ' s an online game where you have to overcome an oil scar gap .
the oil scarcity is invented , but we have enough online content so that it becomes realistic for you and actually live your real life without oil . so , when you sign up for the game , tell us where you live . and then you get news movies in real time that show you how much oil costs , what it ' s not , how food supplies is affected , how transportation is affected , whether schools are closed , whether there are rioturgscy . and you have to figure out how to shape your real life if it were true . and we ask them to talk about it , to on videos or photos . your . , schools we you to talk . it , to watch . you live you oil costs we ask to talk it , make on videos it how . figure
we ' ve tested this game with 1 , 700 players in 2007 , and we ' ve been accompanied accompanying it over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a change experience .
nobody wants to change their lives because it ' s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you ' re in an epic adventure and you ' re told , " we ' re running out of oil . "
this is an amazing adventure go on .
find figure out how they would survive . most of our players have kept the learned habits in the game .
so for the next world - saving game , we set a bigger , higher goal than just oil scarcity .
we ' ve developed the game " superstruct " at the institute for the future .
the starting point is to calculating a supercomputer that humans have only 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called the global extinction sens system , " of course .
to gamers to sign up almost like a " jerry bruckheimer movie .
you know jerry bruckheimer ' s movies , where there ' s the dream team . you have the astronaut , the scientist , the ex - robot , and only together they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say everyone ' s in the dream team , and our job is to create the future of energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8 , 000 players played the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read when if they google " superstruct . "
and the last game we put out on march 3 . it ' s a game collaboration with the world bank .
when you finish the game , you get the world bank the social changer , " ending from 2010 .
we work with universities across over sub - saharan africa and invite them to learn social transformation .
we have a comic on this . we have level high for local understanding , knowledge diversity , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i ' d like to invite of you to share this game with young people all over the world , especially in the developing areas , who are benefiting from bringing their own social enterprises together to save the world .
i ' m going to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven ' t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope you agree that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have all these superpowers , happy productivity , the ability to connect tight social networks , urgency optimism and the desire for epic meaning .
i really hope that together we play major games together to survive another century on this planet .
and i hope you ' ll design games and play with me .
if i look forward into the next decade , i ' m sure about two things : that we can create any imaginable future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let the world - changing games start !
thank you . thank
i ' d like to tell you something that i noticed me a few months ago when writing an article for italian wired .
i ' ve always touch my synonym dictionary writing , but i ' ve done editing the text , and i noticed that i ' ve never looked in my life what the word " disabled " really means .
i ' ll read you the invitation .
" disabled , " adive : " insanpleed , helpless , useless , destroyed , dead , mutilated , wounded , treated , paralyzed , isolated ,ed , stressed , impotent , machized , paralyzed , vascular senil , old - age , pulled out of traffic , repaired , done , broken , empty , injured , useless and weak . ,
antonyme : healthy , strong , powerful . "
i read this list loud to a friend , and i had laugh at first , it seemed so ridiculous , but i only got to " committed " and i couldn ' t keep going , and i had to stop reading and gat after this excessive explosion of words and this emotional shock i with it .
of course , this was a fan , old synonymous dictionary , and i just thought that the paper must be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy in the early ' 80s when i just starting elementary school and started to build and shape my self image outside of my family environment , also in terms of other kids and the of the world around me .
and thank god i didn ' t use a synonym dictionary at the time .
if i took this invitation seriously , i would have been born into a world thatve someone like me as a person whose life can ' t positive in any all way , but today i ' m celebrated for the opportunities and adventures that i ' ve experienced .
so i immediately called the online edition 2009 , and i expected me to find a more appealing contribution here .
here ' s the updated version of this post .
unfortunately , it ' s not much better .
especially , i ' m struck by the last two words by " near antonym " completely " and " healthy . "
but it ' s not just about the words .
it ' s what we think about the people we describe with these words .
it ' s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many of ancient societies , including the greeks and the romans , have really believed that ut a curse has a great force , because what you ' re say out loud can also manifest itself .
so , what do we actually want to manifest - a disabled person or a powerful person ?
just labeling a human mind , mindlessnym as a child could be enough to narrow them down and overhine your ideas .
wouldn ' t it be nice to open doors to ?
a man who opened doors to me was my pediatrician at a . i . dupont institute in wilming , pennsylvania .
he ' s called dr . piztiillo . an italo - american whose name , as you can imagine , most americans couldn ' t say correctly , so he was always called dr . p .
and dr . p . was used always wearing very colorful flies and was just like designed for working with kids .
i just loved the time i spent in this hospital - except for my physical therapy .
i had to repeat individual exercises an infinite with these thick elastic bands - in different colors - you know , to build my leg muscles . and i hated those bands more than anything else . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
and imagine , i actually negotiated as a five - year - old a kid with dr . p . and trying to stop these exercises , of course , not succeed .
and one day he watched me at one of my exercises - these exercises were just tiring and graceing - and he said to me , " wow , aimee , you ' re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you ' re going to tear one of these ribbons .
and if you can do it , i ' ll give you a hundred dollars . "
this , of course , was just a simple trick by dr . p . , so i could do the exercises that i didn ' t want to do with the prospect that the richest five - year - old girl in the hospital on the second floor , but he actually got me to see my daily practice horror with new eyes , so it became a new and promising experience .
and i wonder today how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl shaped my self - image and i could imagine seeing myself as a naturally strong , powerful and at person .
this is just one an example of a lot of how adults in power positions canmulate the imagination a child ' s imagination .
but as the quoted examples from the synonymous dictionaries , our language does not leave us room to imagine something we would all want : allow each individual to see themselves as powerful people .
our language carries behind the social changes that , in many cases have been caused by technological change .
from a medical standpoint , you course can also say that my legs , laser surgery for visually impaired , knee replacement from titan and artificial hip replacements for aging bodies , that really allow people to really use all of their possi and develop beyond the limits that their natural destiny has set , not talking about social networking platforms , people give their own identity , define themselves in their own way , and align to groups that choose themselves .
so maybe this technological change is illust clear than ever that there ' s always been another truth , which is that every human society something very special and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest element .
the human ability to adapt - that ' s an interesting story , because people constantly asking me to tell you how i deal with trouble , and i ' m going to tell you something : this sentence never missed for me , and i ' ve always felt very uncomfortable answer people questions of ' s questions about it , and i think i understand why .
this sentence of dealing with trouble depends on the idea that success or happiness depends on sol fighting a challenge without being shaped by the experience with it , as if my life would been so successful because i could avoid the potential cases of a life with a prosthetic , or whatever people percei me with my disability .
but the truth is that we ' re changing . of course , we ' re shaped by the challenge , whether it ' s physical , emotional or even both .
and i ' m saying that ' s good .
adness are not a obstacle we need to turn to deal with our lives .
adness just belong to of our lives .
and i tend to see of adness as my shadow .
sometimes i realize it ' s very present , sometimes it ' s hardly seen , but it ' s with me all the time .
and i don ' t want to deginisill the impact or the weight of fighting a human being .
there are ades in and challenges in life , and they ' re just all real , and every person dealing with a different way , but the question is not whether we deal with ades or not , but how to we deal with it .
so not only are we responsible for keeping the people we love from fate failure , but also prepare them to deal well .
and we don ' t give our kids a favor when we give them feel like they can ' t adapt .
you have to clearly separate things : one the medical fact of being amputeed and two , the social opinion about whether i ' m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and pers disability i have to deal with is that the world constantly thinks it can describe me with these definitions .
in our desire to protect the people we care about and tell them the cold , hard truth about their medical forecast , or even give a forecast of quality of life that they expect , we need to make sure that we don ' t lay the basis for someone actually disabled .
maybe the current concept that s just attention to what ' s broken in you , and how we fix that is a greater disability for each everyone than the pathology itself .
if we don ' t treat a holistically , and we don ' t percei recognize all of its forces and capabilities , create , in addition to the natural struggle that you might have to lead , we another disease .
we degrading a person who has a value for our society .
so we have to look beyond patology and focus on all the realms of human opportunitybilities .
but most importantly , that there ' s a connection between perception of our inadebility and our great inventionivity .
we shouldn ' t denog or deny these challenges times ; we shouldn ' t try to avoid them , nor should we put them under the carpet , but it ' s about seeing opportunities in the opportunities in the .
i might be more about to realize that we don t necessarily need to overcome necessarily stresses , but that we ' re open to hug them , grab them , and even use a fight expression , and maybe even dance with them .
and maybe we can see of ads as something natural , coherent and useful , and we don ' t feel soered by their presence .
this year , we celebrate the 200th anniversary of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my view , pointed to something very real about human character .
i would describe it this way : not the strongest of his species survives , and not the most intelligent of his kind , but the one who can best adapt to change .
conflict creates creativity .
not only we know from darwin ' s work we know that the ability of man to survive and flourish is determined by the struggle of the human mind to transform through conflict .
so again , change and adaptation are the greatest human capabilities .
and maybe we only first know what wood we ' re made carved out from of when we ' re really tested .
maybe that ' s the sense of adity , a sense of me , a sense of our own power .
we can give something to oursves .
we can give ades a new meaning that goes beyond difficult times .
maybe we can see ad as change .
adversness are a change we haven ' t adapted to yet .
i think the biggest damage that we ' ve done to ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
honestly , who ' s normal ?
there ' s no normal .
there ' s the usual one . it ' s the typical . but not the normal . and would you want to know this poor gray person if they really were ?
i think it ' s not so .
it would be great if we could exchange this paradigm of normality against another of possibilities or strength to actually put it even a little bit more dangerous , so we can release the forces of a lot children , and invite them to bring their very special and valuable skills into society .
the anthropoles has found is that we ' always asked one from the members of our society : be useful and contribute .
there ' s evidence that even neanderthals 60 , 000 years ago carried older humans and humans with severe physical injuries , and that may because the life experience of the battle of survival of these people was valuable for society .
they didn ' t think of these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went to the city i grew up in a grocery store in that red zone in northeast pennsylvania , and i was stood in front of a bee of tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had shorts on .
and i hear a guy behind me saying , " well , that ' s not aimee mullins . "
and i turn around and i see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , " sorry me , sir , do we know ? i can ' t remember her . "
and he said , " well , you could barely remember me .
when i first saw her , i took her out of her mother ' s belly . "
oh , so that one .
and of course , it did click .
this was dr . kean , a man i only from my mother ' s stories about this day , because , of course , typical , came late my birthday two weeks .
my mother ' s preal diagnostic doctor was on vacation , and so my parents didn ' t know the man who born me all .
and because i was born without thi legs , and my feet had turned toward them , and i had only a few toes on this foot and a few toes on the other foot , he was the translator , this stranger had to send the bad news .
he said to me , " i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and would never be as active as other children , or that you could never live an independent life , and since then they just shot me lie . "
what was really extraordinary i was that he collected newspaper clips of my entire childhood , whether i had won at a spelling competition in second grade , whether i was been with the padrs at the parade to halloween , whether i ' d won my scholarship or one of my sporting victories , and he used these clips to teach his students , medical students from harremann medical school and hershey medical school .
and he called this part of his course the x factor , the potential of human will .
you just ' t emphasize enough how critical this factor can be for a the quality of life .
and dr . kean kept on said , he said , " i ' ve learned that kids , if they don ' t say anything something else all the time , and even if they only get a little support , if you leave kids to themselves , kids can do a lot . "
you see , dr . kean changed his thinking .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone deals with it , are two different things .
and i ' also changed my thinking over time , if they asked me at the age of 15 , asked if i had switchedved my prostheses against legs of flesh and bone , i wouldn ' t stopped a second .
i wanted to look normal at the time .
if you ask me today , i ' m not so sure .
and that ' s happened because i ' ve experienced something with my legs , and not despite those experiences .
and maybe this change could also happen because i ' ve met so many people who have opened doors to me rather than meet people who wanted to lock me or give create me an idea .
see , it really takes is just one person to demonstrate them how to manifest your forces , and you ' re through it .
if you allow someone to activate their own inner forces - the human mind is so essential - if you can do that , and you open a door at a critical moment , they ' re a very good teacher for these people .
they teach them to open doors to themselves .
the real meaning of the word " educate " is rooted in the word " educe . "
it means producing something that is in one , to shake out the potential .
again , what potential do we want to use now ?
in the 1960s in u . k . , did a case study , and then high schools were transformed into independent schools .
they call this streaming trials " there in the united states , we call this tracking .
the students are divided by grades .
and the a students are literally tested harder , the better teachers get and so on .
they then gave students over a three - month - period of with a " enough " very good , " they were told they were oka they were very smart , and after those three months , they really wrote one .
and of course , it breaks you your the heart hear that con course , the one - year students were told they were re were just enough .
and that ' s the same after the three months .
but only those who were still in school - except for the students who thrown out of school .
and the key about this study was that the teachers weren ' t ex up .
the teachers didn ' t know that something was changed .
they were just told that you are the one - students and that are re the students at the grade enough , and way they taught them and treated them .
the only real disability is a broken mind , a mind that has been broken no hope . he can ' t find anything beautiful . he lacks our natural childlike curiosity , and our innate capacity of imagination .
but if we can support the human mind continue hopeing to find yourself itself and other people around them beautiful , be curious and imaginative , we really emze our forces positively .
if a mind has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new forms of existence .
i want to end with a poem written by a persian poet called haz in the 14th century , and that my friend jacques dembois told me , and the poem is called " the god who only knows four words . " every child knows god , not the god of names , not the god of probids , but the god who knows only four words and repeat them all the time , always says , " come , dance with me . "
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
suppose i said that , through few changes in your genes , you could have better memory - more precise , more accurate and faster .
or do you want to be fitier , stronger , have more strength .
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
how about living with good health longer ?
or maybe you ' re one of those who ' ve always been craving for more creativity .
which one would you like the most ?
which what would you like want if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about as many as there creative people here .
that ' s very good .
how many would choose to good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to say do that , as a doctor .
if you could only have one of these , it would be a very different world .
is this all just illusion ?
or perhaps it possible ? .
evolution has been a continuous topic here at the ted conference , but today i want to give you a doctor ' s view about this subject .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , t . g . barzhnovky , who was also a communist in the russian orthodox church , once wrote an essay titled , " nothing in biology makes t make sense but in the light of evolution . "
now , if you ' re one of those who doesn ' t accept the evidence for biological evolution , that would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aids , take your personal communication aids - i ' ll give you permission - and maybe you can take a look at kathryn schnez ' s book , which is wrong , because nothing in the course of this talk will make any sense for you .
but if you accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it validlicable to others , or does it affecting us ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in this picture , i put a bush as a center of branches in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all existing species at the top of these branches have succeeded in evolutionary terms : they survived ; it has demonstrated fitness and strength its environment .
the human part of this bush , way to at the end , of course , is what we ' re most interested in .
we go from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in that period , maybe there were maybe 20 or 25 different species of hominids .
some have come and gone .
we ' ve been here for about 130 , 000 years .
it seems that we ' re quite remote from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually for most of part , the fundamental mechanisms our cells are quite similar .
do you realize that we can use benefits from this and recrowct the mechanisms of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that ' s used to treat diabetic ?
this is not like human insulin ; this is the same protein ; that is chemically differentable from what ' s comes from the pancreatic .
and when we ' re talking about bacteria , do you realize that each of us in our gut has more bacteria than it does do cells in the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , do you think when antonio damasio asks about your self - image , do you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderfully hospital friendly environment for these bacteria .
it ' s warm , it ' s dark , it ' s wet , it ' s very comfortable .
and you ' re going to offer them all the nutrients that they could only want without effort their themselves own .
it ' s really a easy way for bacteria , with occasional interruption of the unintended , especially push the exit .
but otherwise , they ' re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they are important for their lives .
they help digest essential nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will s going to happen in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium in the form of a species ?
or are we likely to become something else - something that might be even better adapted to the environment ?
now let ' s take a step back to the time of the big bang 14 billion years ago - the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago - the first signs of living , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth - the first multi - million organisms , maybe so much as 800 or a billion years ago - and then the human species , that forms in the last 130 , 000 years .
in this huge unfinished symphony of the universe , life on earth is only briefly measured ; the animal kingdom , like a single beat ; and human life , a little .
that ' s us . that .
this also represents the entertainment value of this talk , so i hope d you enjoyed it .
now , when i was a new kid in college , i had my first biology classes .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i found something very fundamental : most of them , the existence of life exists in single - celled organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information from the cell is then carried on in both daughter cells .
but at the time that multicellular organisms appeared , things began to change .
sexual reproduction comes into the picture .
and most importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction , which passes the genome , the rest of the body becomes alience .
in fact , you could say that the inevitability of death of our bodies occurs in at the same moment as sexual reproduction .
now i have to admit , when i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex - it seemed pretty rationalable at that point , but with every year , it had come to my growing doubts .
i came to understand the feelings of george burns performing his show in the ' 90s .
and one night , there ' s a tap at his hotel room door .
he opens the door .
him he is s a beautifully , poorly - dressed show girl front of him .
she looks at him and she says , " i ' m here for super - sex . "
" that ' s wonderful , " george says , " i ' m going to take the soup . "
i came to the conclusion as a doctor that i was built a goal that was different than the goal of evolution - not necessarily contradictory , just different .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i wanted to restore the health after a disease .
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about passing the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation after generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , you and i are developed like booster rockets to send genetic shipping to the next stage of the orbit , and then drop fall into the sea .
i think we ' d all understand the mood that woody allen expressed when he said , " i don ' t want to achieve immortality through my work .
i want to do it by not dying . "
evolution isn doesn ' t necessarily prefer the longest life .
it doesn ' t necessarily privilute the biggest , the strongest or the fastest , even the smartest .
evolution impvilates the creatures that best ada adapted to their environment .
it ' s just the test of survival and success .
at the bottom of the ocean , there are bacteria there that are thermophil and therefore keep the hot steam , if fish were there , it would have vacuum - cooked fish , but they managed to make a habitable environment for themselves .
so , what does that mean if we look back at what happens in evolution , and how we think about the place humans in evolution , andly as we look forward into the next phase , i would say that there are a number of possibilities .
the first is that we ' re not going to evolve .
we ' ve achieved some kind of balance .
and the reason for that was that first all , we first through medicine , we to get a lot of genes that would have otherwise been selected out and been removed from the population .
and secondly , as a species , we have designeded our environment so that we managed to adapt to us just as adapt to them .
and by the way , we wand travelrate and circulate and mix so much that they can ' no longer say that isolation is necessary for evolution to take happen place .
the second possibility is that it ' s going to be a evolution of traditional species , of course , imposed by nature ' s forces .
and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution are slowly slowng , but they ' re insrelpectificale .
and as far as isolation goes , if we colonize distant planets as , there will be isolation and the changes in the environment that could produce evolution naturally .
but there ' s a third possibility , a tempting , fascinating and terrifying possibility .
i call it neo - evolution - the new development that which is not just natural , but led and determined by us as individuals , in the choices we make .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do that ?
let ' s first look at the reality that people today , in some cultures , make decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , a choice to have more men than women .
it ' s not necessarily good for society , but it ' s what the individual and the family decide .
so think , if only if not it be possible to choose the gender of your child , but also make do genetic adaptations on the body would cure and prevent the disease .
what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer ' s or eliminate reducing the risk of cancer or strokes ?
wouldn ' t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
if we look progress forward , these kinds of changes will increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2 . 7 billion dollars .
the next year , when it finished in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in three to four months .
today , you can complete a sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a price of about 20 , 000 dollars and into the room of about a week .
it won ' t going to take long longer for the reality to be that there will be the 1 , 000 - dollar human genomes , and it will s going to be available for everyone .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering gave the draper prize to francis arnold and willem stemmer , two scientists who developed independently that encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and lead to desiredable proteins in a more efficient way - which frances arnold calls " direct evolution . "
a few years ago , the lasker prize awarded to the scientist shinya yamaka for his research in which he took a an adult skin cell , a fibroid , and by manipulapulation just four genes that the cell to turn it to a pluripotent stem cell - a cell is potentially able to become any cell in your body .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that the human insulin produces in bacteria can make viruses that can not only protect themselves , but also serve immunizing against other viruses .
believe it or not , it ' s an experimental studyway with vaccine against influenza that planted in the cells of a tobaccotte plant .
can you imagine something good coming out of tobaccogarette ?
this is all reality today , and in the future will be much more possible .
so just imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change your nei ' cells ?
what if you could change the sperm and egg or the fresh - fertilized egg to give your children a better chance for a healthier life - eliing diabetes ,minat reducing hemophilia , reduce the risk of cancer ?
who doesn ' t want healthier kids ?
and then the analytical technology , the same engine of science that can changes to prevent disease , could also enable allow us to adopt any super - attributes , hyper - capacity - the better memory .
why don ' t the power speed of ken jennings hb , especially if you can expand it with the next generation of watson machine ?
why not have the fast fibers that will allow them to walk faster and longer ?
why no longer live ?
these will be compt .
and if we ' re at a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we ' re going to transformed from old - style evolution to neo - evolution .
we ' re going to have a process that usually takes maybe 100 , 000 years , and we can compress it down to a thousand years - and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions that their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , have to deal with .
do we use these decisions to form a society that ' s better , that s more successful , that is more friendly ?
or are we going to selectively choose different attributes that we want to have for some of us and rather not for some of us ?
will we form a society that is linearer and more uniform , or more robust and more diverse ?
these are the kinds of questions we ' re going to face .
and most deepest of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and master the wisdom that we ' re going to need to make these decisions way ?
for good or for evil , and earlier than you might think , these decisions will be true on us .
thank you .
now i want you to imagine something a portable robot that gives you superhuman skills , or another one that help wheelchair users stand up and walk .
we at berkeley bionics call these robots exoskeletons .
they ' re nothing but something that you put up in the morning and that gives them extra strength and that will continue to increase their speed and will help them keep their balance , for example .
this is actually the real confluence of human and machine .
but not only that - merge and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
it ' s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we ' re working on , we ' re starting talking about the american soldier who ' s on average with about 100 pounds on his back , and there ' s a demand that you should wear more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications - spin injury , 30 percent of it - chronic injury .
so we thought that we would take this challenge and create an exoskelet that would help deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you to hulc - or the human universal load carrier .
soldier : with the hulc exoskelet , i can carry 200 pounds over different terrain for many hours .
his flexible design allows you to sit deep , crawl and do highly agile movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then increase my strength and resilience .
we ' re ready to introduce with our industrial partner device , this new exoskelet this year .
so it ' s true .
now let ' s take our look at wheelchair users , something that i ' m particularly passionate interested about .
there are 68 million people around the world are sitting in a wheelchair .
that ' s about one percent of the population .
and this is actually a conservative estimate .
we often talking about very young people with spinal cord injuries who were struck in the height of their lives - 20s , ' 30s , 40s - , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it ' s also about the aging population , whose number is multiying .
and pretty much the only option - when it ' comes to a stroke , or other complications - is the wheelchair .
and so by the way , it ' s been 500 years , since its , i have to say , its very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start writing a whole new chapter in mobility .
now let me introduce you to amness being carried by amanda boxtel , who had a spinal cord injury 19 years ago that which resulted that she couldn ' t walk for 19 years and so far .
thank you .
as i said , amanda wears our misery .
it has sensors .
its completely non - invasive sensors in the crutches send back signals to our onboard computer , which is attached on your back .
here are also battery packs , the engine drive is on your hips , as well as your their knees that they move forward in this fairly smooth and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old and i was in the best position when a monstrous pur tree was paraly me on a ski trip paraly me .
for a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement underneath my pel .
not long after that , a doctor walked into my hospital room and he said , " amanda , you ' ll never be able to leave again . "
and this was 19 years ago .
he steeled every spark of hope from my consciousness .
adaptive technologies have allowed me to learn to ski again , climb , and even bike with my hands .
but nothing was invented that would let me go back so far .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet us and talk with them .
it ' s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change life of future generations - not just for the soldiers , or for amanda here and all the wheelchair users , but for everyone .
thank you .
at home in new york , i ' m the head of the development department of a nonprofit called robin hoffman .
if i don ' t fight poverty , as help a fireman , i fight fire in a volunteer fire the .
now , in our town where volunteers were supporting a highly trained professional force , you have to be at the firefrontwell pretty early to join .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer at the fire station , so i had pretty good chances to get in .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach the commander and figure out what our tasks would be .
when i found the captain , he was having in a very serious conversation with the janowner , who certainly had one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she stood in the sleeping suit and her barefoot under a umbrella outside in the flowing rain while her house was in fire .
the other volunteer who had arrived just front to me - let ' s call him lex martin - first met the captain the first and was asked to go to the house and save the house owner ' s dog .
the dog ! i was terrified enied .
there was some lawyer or trust manager who , now , for the rest of his life , could tell people that he went to a burning house to save a living thing , just because he was five seconds faster than i did .
well , i was next .
the captain waveed me .
he said , " bezos , you have to go to the house .
you have to go up , past the fire , and you have to get this woman a pair of shoes . "
i swear .
now , not exactly what i expected to do , but i went - down up the stairs , down the hallirway , past the real firemen , who were ,ting pretty done at that the time to get into the bedroom to get a few shoes .
i know what you ' re thinking now , but i ' m not a hero .
i was carrying my prey back down , where i on the door met my predator and beloved dog .
we carried our treasures out to the home owner , where , not surprisingly , he got his a lot more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the fireman got a letter from the home owner thankging herself for brave effort of saving her house .
arecd kindness : somebody had even brought her a pair of shoes .
both in my career with robin hood and in my careerlance as a volunteer fireman , i ' m witnessed generosity and kindness on a large scale , but i also see actions of humruism and courage of individuals .
and you know what i ' ve learned ?
they ' re all important .
so when i look around this room and i see people who have either achieved a remarkable success or are on their way there , i want to offer this memory : don ' t wait .
don ' t wait to make a difference in someone else ' s life until you reach your first million .
if you have something to give , give it now .
service in a soup kitchen , clean up a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us a chance to save a human ' s life , but every day gives us the opportunity to change one .
so go ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno giacometi : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i ' m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of humanity human .
a place where women lead the bread with sex " hello , " and the game determines the day - where fun is a serious thing .
and no , it ' s not burning man or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , your family .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the of congo .
bonobos are our closest living relatives withpans .
that means that we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
now chimpanzees are famous for their aggression .
but unfortunately , we have ve overestimated that effect in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos showing us the other side of the coin .
while chimpanzees are run by big , fearying guys , the bonobo society is run by empowered females .
they really come came up with it , because this leads to a very tolerant society where lethal violence has not been seen .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least known among the primates .
they live in the depths of the congo basin jungle , and they ' re difficult to observe observation .
the congo is a paradox - a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself - the scene of a violent struggle that has been crying for decades and caused almost as many lives as the first world war .
it ' s not surprising that this destruction also harmens the of bonobos survival .
meat trade and the decline of the tree leads you couldn ' t even fill a stadium with the remaining bonobos - and even there , we ' re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a hidden laugh that smashs the trees .
who are these relatives ?
we know them as " love instead of war " monkeys because they have frequent , also heterosexual sex , with alter partners , and they regula conflict and social issues .
i ' m not saying that would be the answer to all humanitarian problems - because the of the bono ' s lives consists more than the kama sutra .
bonobos - like humans - love to play their lives .
play doesn ' t just play .
for us and it play is fundamental to attachment relationships and foster tolerance .
and we learn trust and the rules of the game .
play increases creativity and resilience , and it ' s all about creating diversity - diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and when you look watch bonobos in the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human laughter , dances and rituals .
play is the tile that holds us together .
now , i don ' t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique footage right from the wild .
first , a ball game of bonobo kind - and i don ' t think of football .
so here we see a young female and male in a chase game .
look at what it does .
this could be the evolutionary origin of , " she grabs it in the eggs . "
just that i think he ' s rather like more like it , right .
yeah !
so sex games are common , both in bonobos and in humans .
and this video is really interesting because it shows - and this video is really interesting because it shows the ideas that bring new elements into the game - like the testicles - and also how the game promotes trust and encouragetures trust - at the same it ' s tremendous fun .
but the game is a shape - shifter .
play is a shape shifter , and it can take be many shapes , some of which a little quietrer , imaginative , curious - maybe to rediscover the wonder .
and i want to show you , this is fuku , a young female , and she plays with water peacefully .
i think just like you , we sometimes play alone , and we stretch out the boundaries of our inner and outer worlds .
and it ' s this playful curiosity that lets us explore and interact , and the unexpected links that we form are the real breeding ground of creativity .
this is just a little taste of the insights that bonobos give us into our past and present .
but they also are a secret to our future , a future where we need to adapt to increasing challenges through greater creativity and increasingly increased cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our adaptation dragon .
to successfully adapted to an insent world , we have to play .
but are we going to make the best of our game drive ?
play is not silly .
it ' s essential . it
for bonobos and humans equally , life is not made up of teeth and claws alone .
just when it seems barely appropriate , play is perhaps the most necessary .
and so , my primatemates , let ' s embrace this gift of evolution and play together as we rediscover creativity , friendship and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , in the middle of 1979 , exactly the same day , exactly the same moment , each one has a baby - okay .
so two pairs , each of one has a baby .
now , i don ' t want you to spend too much time to imagine the childbirture , because if you imagine the childth all the time , you ' re ' not going to listen to me .
just think imagine it for a moment .
and in this scenario , you imagine that in one case the sperm has a y chomoso hitting the x chromosome of the egg .
and in the other case , the sperm has an x chromosome that hits the x chromosome of the egg .
both ' re survivalble , both sparks healing .
we ' ll come back to these people later .
for most of my work , i have two hats .
under a hat , i ' m looking with the history of anatomy .
i ' m a studied a historian , and in this case i study how people dealt with anatomy - which is human bodies , animal bodies - how they deal with body fluids , with body concepts ; how they thought about bodies .
the other hat i ' ve wore in my work is the activist , as a patient lawyer - or , as i sometimes say , as an impatient lawyer - of people who are patients from doctors .
in this case , i worked with people who have body types who question social norms .
so for example , i worked with people who are thai twins , two people in one body .
i worked with people with dwarfism - so people who were smaller than usual .
and a lot often i ' ve worked with intergenderxu people whose gender is exotic - so people who don ' t have the average male or female types .
and as a general term , we can use the word intergenderxuali .
intergenderxuity is in many different forms .
i ' m just going to give you a few examples of the potential types of gender varieties that don ' t meet the male standard or female standard .
in one case , you might have someone with a xy chromosome dna , and the sry gene of the y chomosom grows the protogonals that we all have fetal stage into testi .
and that ' s why the testes releasing testosterone at the fet stage .
but because this individual is lack the receptors to recognize the testosterone , the body doesn ' t respond to the testosterone .
and that ' s called an androne receptor bug .
so lot of testosterone , but not no reaction to it .
as a result , the body develop more as the typical female path .
when the child is born , it looks like a girl .
she ' s a girl . she ' s raised as a girl .
but it takes most of time you to reach puberty and her breasts to grow and develop , but she doesn ' t get your period until someone to come out that something different here .
and they do some tests , and they find that instead of having ovaries and uterus , it actually has testicles in it and that it has a y chromosome .
it ' s important to understand that you could actually think of this person as actually male , but they ' re not really .
women , like men , have bodies something called adrenalin glands .
they ' re in the back of our bodies .
and the side -sides make androroggens which are virgeni hormones .
most women , like me - i think i ' re a typical woman - i don ' t know my actual chromosome structure , but i think i probably have the typical one - most women like me actually talk to androns .
we produce androgens , and we respond to androgens .
the consequence is that someone like me actually has a brain that was exposed more androgen than a woman born with testicles and had an androgen receptor bug .
so gender is really complicated ; intersexus are not t just in the middle of the spectrum of gender - in some way , they can be spread across the entire range .
here ' s another example : a few years ago , i got the phone call of a 19 - year - old man who was born as a boy , raised as a boy , he had a girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived as a man , and he had just foundd out that he had ovaries and a uterus .
he had an extreme form of an innate sideest depression .
he has 20 chromosomes , and in the womb , his sideprosides were so active that they basically created a male hormone environment .
and as a consequence result , his genitalies were exposed to male , and his brain was exposed to the typical male part of the hormone spectrum .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy - nobody knew anything .
and it wasn ' t until he turned 19 that he got enough medical problems , in fact because he wasvadecting inside , that the doctors found that he was female inside .
okay , just a quick example of a version of intergenderity .
some people with xx chromosomes develop something called ovotte , which where ovarian tissue is covered by testi tissue .
we don ' t know exactly why this is happening .
so gender can occur in many different ways .
the reason why children with this kind of body - whether it ' s dwarfism or thai twins , whether it ' s intergenderxual - are often adapted to the norms , is not because it would be good for their physical health .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they ' re often done different kinds of surgical surgery is because they threaten our social categories .
typically , our system is based on the idea that a certain anatomic pattern is with a particular identity .
so we have the concept that being a woman is having a female identity ; being a black person is supposedly have an african anatomy in terms of your own story .
so we have this terly simplistic idea .
and when we ' re faced with a body that actually is something very different to us , we ' s confused in terms of these categorizations .
so we have in our culture a lot of romantic ideas about individualism .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
now you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born , who are two people in one body .
where i ' d seen the most excitement recently was the south african runner caster semenya last year , who whose gender was questioned at the physical world in berlin .
a lot of journalists called me with the question , " what test are you going to do to tell us whether caster semenya is female or male ? "
and i had to explain to the journalists that there was no test there .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we need to admit that nature doesn ' t make a line between male and female , or between male and inter and female and inter ; we ' s us who propose that line as natural .
so we have a situation where , the further our science progress , we have to admit that these categories that we thought were stable anatomical categories , that made very simple assignments to create permanent identity categories , are much more darkrry than we assumed . so
and that ' s not just in terms of gender .
it ' s also true in terms of race , which turns out to be much more complicated than our terminology has allowed .
in our view , we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas .
for example , we find the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna in common with chimpanzees .
what should we do with the fact that we ' re are different from them by a few nucleotides ?
as we keep move our science further forward , we ' re increasingly getting into a zone of discomfort where we have to recognize that the simplistic categories that we had are probably too simple .
we see this in all sorts of parts of human life .
one of the areas in which we see this playplay , in our culture today , in today ' united states , is the battles over the beginning and the end of life .
we have hard conversations about at where a body becomes human , so that it has a different right than fetal life .
we have very difficult arguments today - maybe not as public as in medicine - about question of when someone is dead .
our ancestors never had so hard to fight with the question of when someone was dead .
you had somebody a feather under their nose , and as it moved , they havenn ' t buried them yet .
if it didn ' t moving , they buried her .
but today we ' re in a situation where we want taking vital organs from people and we want to transrod to other people .
and as a result , we ' re caught ourselves in fighting with the really difficult question of when someone ' s dead , and that puts us into a really difficult situation where we don ' t have as simple categories as we used to do .
now you might think that the whole breakdown of categories would really make someone like me happy .
i ' m politically progressive , i defend people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit it makes me nervous .
to understand that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought makes me excite .
and it makes me excite about thinking about democracy .
so to tell you about this tension , first i have to say that i ' m a big fan of the founding fathers .
i know they were racists , i know they were sexists , but they were great .
i think they were so brave and so strong , and so radical in what they did , that i find myself every few years watching the grim music in 1776 , and it ' s not because of the music that ' s absolutely forgotten .
it ' s because of what happened to the founding fathers in 1776 .
the founding fathers , in my view , were the original anatomical activists , and that ' s why .
what they pointed was an anatomical concept , and they replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful , and that was 200 essential to us .
as you all remember , our founding fatherss rejected the concept of the monarchy , and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplified concept of anatomy .
the rulers of the ancient world had no concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of birth rights .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they believed that people who had political power should have this political power because of the inherited blood line from the grandfather to father to son and so on .
the founding fathers rejected back this idea and replaced it with a new anatomical concept , and that concept said that all people were created equally .
they lookedped the playground , and they decided that , anatomically , the similarities , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they did this in part because they were part of a revial system where two things grew up together .
democracy grew , but at the same time science grew .
if you look at the story of the founding fathers , it becomes clear that many of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a naturalist world .
they went away from explanations of supernatural species , andfold things like a supernatural concept of power , where the transmission is based on a very vague concept of birth law .
they moved towards a naturalist concept .
and for example , if you look at the declaration of independence , they ' talk about nature and the god of nature .
they ' re not talking about god and the nature of god .
they ' re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , they gave us a concept about anatomical similarities .
and so in a really wonderful way they prepared the future civil rights movement .
they didn ' t think about it that way , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened years after that ?
for example , women who aspired the right to used the concept of founding fathers , which says that anatomical commonality is more important than the anatomical difference , and said , " that we have a uterus and ovaries not significant enough that we shouldn ' t have the right , the right to have full citizenship , the right to own property , etc . , etc . "
and women argued .
next was the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like fellow truth , fun , " am ' m i a woman ? "
we find men in the march rows of the civil rights movement who say , " i ' m a man . "
again , people of different skin color relying on anatomic similarities before anatomic differences , again , successful .
we see the same thing in the disability rights movement .
of course , the problem is that , as we start look at all the commonities , we need start to question why we sustain certain divisions .
now , by the way , i want to maintaintain certain divisions , anatomically , in our culture .
for example , i want to give a fish the same rights as a human being .
i don ' t want to say that we should take away from anatomy .
i don ' t want to say that five year olds should have the right to give their consent on sex or to marry .
so there are some anatomical divisions that make sense for me , and that i think we should keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out which they are and why we keep them , and whether they ' re usefulful .
so let ' s go back to these two creatures that were created at the beginning of the talk .
we created two creatures , both , in the mid of 1979 , exactly the same day .
let ' s imagine one of them , maria , was born three months prematurely , so she ' s born june 1 , 1980 .
henry , on the other hand , is born to the date of birth , so he ' s born on march 1st , 1980 .
just because of the fact that maria was born three months prematurely , she gains all kinds of rights three months before henry - the right to have consensus sex , the right to choose , the right to drink .
henry has to wait for all of this , not because he actually has a different biological age , just because of the time he was born .
we find other oddities about what their rights are .
henry , since you assume he ' s male - although i didn ' t tell you that he ' s the with xy - because you assume that he ' s male , he can now be drawn in , which maria doesn ' t have to worry about .
however maria can ' t in all states have the same right that henry has in all states , which is the right to marry .
elizabeth can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only marry one woman in a few states .
so we have these permanent anatomic categories that which are problematic and questionable in many ways .
and for me , the question is , : what are we going to do because our science is making such advances in anatomy that we to a point where we have to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could fall apart ?
i don ' t want to give up science , but at the same time it feels like science is self - itself .
so where do we go ?
it seems that our culture takes a kind of pragmatic position : " well , we have to draw a line somewhere , so we have to draw it somewhere . "
but a lot of people are caught in a very strange position .
so for example , texas at one point , texas decided that to marry a man means you don ' t have a y chromosome , and marry a woman means you have a y chromosome .
now in practice , people are not tested on their chromosomes .
but it ' s also very bizarre because of the story i first told you about the androne receptor bug .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr . martin luther king , in his " i have a dream , " he offers us a kind of solution .
he says that we should judge people by " their skin color , but by the character of their character , " and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , " yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . "
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you judge people by on their personality ?
i also want to point out that i ' m not sure that we should disbute rights in terms to people so , because i have to admit that i know a number of golden retrievers who probably likely deserve social benefits than some people i know .
i want to say that i probably also know some bright dog dogs who are more able to make ambit , more smart and more mature decisions about their sexual relationships than some 40 - year - olds i know .
so how do we operational conceptualize the question of the properties of the character ?
it turns out to be really hard .
and part of me wondering , what if the content of a personality was something that would machine readable in the future - be visible using fmri ?
do we really want to go that way ?
i ' m not sure where we ' re going .
what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is leading to thinking about questions of democracy .
in our effort for democracy , we ' ve done our really well , and i think we ' d do our thing good in the future .
we don ' t have the situation , as , example case in iran , where a man who s sexually drawn to other men is punished to death , unless he ' s willing to go a sexual transformation , in which case he can stay alive .
conditions of this kind don ' t exist about us .
i ' m happy to say that we don ' t have these conditions - a surgeon i talked to a few years ago who had brought a few thai twins to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i was talkinged to him and i asked him why he was doing these surgeries - they were very risky surgeries - his answer was that in his country , these children were be treated very poorly , and that ' s he had to do it .
i told him , " now have you consider political asylum instead of an operation to separate you ? "
the united states provides incredible opportunities to allow people to be the they are , without having to change for the state .
so i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to conclude , i want to notice that i talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the ways that democracy might look like , or might have looked like if we had mothers more involved .
and i want to say something that ' s a little bit radical for a feminist , and that is that i think there could may be different kinds of insights that come from different kinds of anatomy , especially when people apply a group thinking .
for years , because i ' ve been interested in intergenderxuity , i ' ve also been interested in research on gender variation .
and one of the things that i found really interesting is the difference between men and women in of how they think and operate in the world .
what we ' ve from culturally cross - cultural studies is that women , on average - not everyone them , but on average - tend to pay attention complex social relationships and care for people who are vulnerable within the group , pay a lot of attention .
and that so , when we think about it , we have an interesting situation ahead to us .
years ago , when i graduated from graduate school , one of my graduate assistant , who knew my interest in feminism - i saw myself as a feminist , i do - asked a really strange question .
he said , " tell me what is s female about feminism . "
and i thought , " well , that ' s the stupidest question i ' ve ever heard .
feminism is abouting stereotypes about gender , so feminism is not female .
but the more i thought about his question , the more i thought there could be something female in feminism .
that mean , there could might be something , on average , where female brains are different from male , which makes us more aware about highly complex social relationships , and more alert to the protect needy .
so where the founding fathers were extremely focused in figuring out how individuals could be protected from the state , it ' s possible that if we brought more mothers into this concept , we could get more a concept of not just how to protect , but how we to take care for each other .
and maybe that ' s where we need to go in the future , if we take democracy beyond anatomy - thinking less think about the individual body in terms of identity , and think more about relationships .
so that as we try to make a more perfect connection as people , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i ' m jessica , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have in it , i ' m going to make a very public confession , and that ' s , i ' m obsessed with outfits .
i love for any opportunity time to find a different colorful , crazy outfit , and recently photographing and blogging recently .
but i don ' t buy anything new .
i get all my secondhand clothes in marketplaces and second - hand shops .
ooh , thank you .
second - hand shopping allows me to reduce the impact of my clothes on the environment and also that impact on my wallet .
i meet all sorts of great people ; my dollars usually serve a good cause ; i look pretty unique ; and it makes shopping my personal treasure .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it have my big ? .
am i going to like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
when all the answers are loud , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase and i ll tell you what i ve packed up this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does someone bring with so many outfits ?
so i ' m going to show you very exactly what i brought with me .
i brought seven pair of underwear , and that ' s all .
underwear for exactly a week are all i did in my suitcase .
i decided that i would find everything else i might want to wear if i first came to palm springs .
and since you haven ' t heard about me as the woman who ' s walking around at in her underwear at ted - that means i ' ve found a few things .
and i really want to show you my outfits for this week .
does that sound good ?
as i do that , i ' m also going to give you some of the lessons that , believe it or not , i learned from these adventures not to carry anything new from these .
let ' s start with sunday .
i call this the bright tiger .
you don ' t have to spend lot of money looking great .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jacket , cost me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece i wore in this week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it ' s almost physiologically impossible to be bad when you ' re wearing bright pants .
when you ' re happy , you attract other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation is totally overestimated .
i ' ve spent a lot of my life trying to be myself and adapting at the same time .
just be who you are .
if you ' re surrounded you with the right people , not only will you understand it , they you will also appreciate it .
wednesday : em hubrag your inner child .
sometimes people tell me that i looked like i ' m playing " dress up , " or i remind you of their seven - year - old .
i like to lau smile and say , " thank you . "
thursday : self - confidence is the key .
if you think you look good in something good , it ' s almost sure .
and if you think you don ' t look good in something , you ' re probably right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me day after day .
but it wasn ' t until i turned 30 that i really understood what that means .
and i ' m going to summariz that for you .
if you believe that you ' re a wonderful person inside and outside , there ' s nothing you can ' t wear .
so there ' s no excuse for somebody in this audience .
we should be able to rock anything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth - five words : golden challet fit with everything .
and finally , saturday : developing your own unique personal style is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
it was proved to over and over again when people came up to me this week just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously it ' s not going to fit in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i ' m going to donate it all again .
because the lesson i ' m trying to learn this week is that it ' s okay to let go .
i don ' t have to pick emotionally these things , because right around the corner , there will always be another crazy , colorful , bright outfit that only waiting for me if i have a little bit of love in my heart and search for it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good day , everybody together .
i have something i want to show you .
think of this as a point , as a flying spot .
this is what we call in our lab perual design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture - i ' m originally italian , and every boy in italy is growing up this picture in his room , but the reason i ' m showing you this is that something very interesting happened in the last few decades .
a while ago , if they wanted to win a formula 1 race , they took their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now today , if you want to win a race , you actually need something like this - something that the car monitor in real time , has a few thousand sensors , pass information from the car , pass that information to the system and then process it , and then use it to send decisions back car and change things in real time while information is collected .
this these would call , in engineering teams , a real - time control system .
and basically it ' slly a system made up of two parts - a senseing part and a reactive part .
what ' s interesting today is that real - time control systems begin beginning to emerge in our lives .
our cities , in over the last few years , have been equipped with networks and electronics .
they become computers in the open .
and as computers open , they start reactcting in different ways , they ' re perceived and driven .
when we lighted cities , that ' s actually a big deal .
just by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the world ' s surface , but 50 percent of the world ' s population lives there .
they ' re 75 percent of the energy consumption - generating up to 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
so when we do something with the cities , that ' s a big deal .
beyond the cities , all of this perve and drive it into objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhibition that paola antonelli organized for moma later the year during the summer .
it ' s called " talk to me . "
now , all of our objects , our environment , begin to speak back to us .
in a certain sense , it ' s almost as if every atom out there becomes both , a sensor and a generator .
and that radically changes the interaction that we humans have outside with our environment .
in a way , it ' s almost like the old dream of michelangelo .
you know , when michelangelo shape the moses , it says that at he ended up took the hammer and threw it on moses - in fact , you can still see a little spot below the - and he said , " perch non parli ? why don ' t you talk ? "
well , today , our environment begin to answer us the first time .
i ' m just going to show you a few examples - again , with the idea of percei and driving our environment .
let ' s start with perving .
now the first project i want to introduce to you is actually one of the first of our lab .
it was born four and a half years ago in italy .
and what we did then was actually using a new kind of network that was deployed all over the world - this is a mobile phone network - and using anonymous and arrangedd information from this network that ' s being collected by the operator to understand how the city works . and
the summer was a happy summer - 2006 .
it was when italy won the football world cup .
some of you will remember it was when italy was against france , and then at the end , the , the head slam .
and anyway , italy ended up winning .
now look at what happened that day , just watching the activity that ' s happening in the network .
here you see the city .
you see in the colossal in the , the river of the ti .
the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline up the there .
early afternoon , people here and there making phone calls and moving .
the game starts - silence .
france makes a gate . italy makes a gate .
half - time , people make a quick phone call , go to bathroom .
second half season . end of normal play .
first goal , second .
zi , in a moment the headpees .
italy wins . yeah .
now , that night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
they saw the big deal .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the winner team and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everybody went down .
you see the picture of the place called ci massimo , where , since the roman era , people go to celebrate - to have a big party , and you see the drop at the end of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we can feel the city today in a way that we couldn ' t do it a few years ago .
quickly , another example of traces : this is not about people , it is about things that we use and consume .
well , today we know everything about where our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that make up a mac computer how they came together .
but we know very little about where the things go .
so in this project , we actually designed some little markers to track the garbage as it goes through the system .
so we started with a few volunteers who helped us , a little over a year ago , in seattle tag the things they were throw throwing away - different kinds of things you can see - things that they would throw away anyway .
then we put the little chips , the little brands , on the garbage and we started tracking it .
here are the results that we just got .
from seattle .
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there are a lot of inefficies in the system .
we can actually the same things with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but there ' s a lot of unnecessary transportation and complicated things that happen .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day , that the cup that we throw away doesn ' t just disappear , that it ' s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we throw away every day still remains there .
and if we showed that people , then we can drive behavior change .
so that ' s reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , assaf bidrishan , could tell you a lot more about perceiving and the many other wonderful things that you can do with perceiving , but i ' d like to talk to the second part that we discusseded at the beginning , and that ' s the activity of our environment . my
and the first project is something we did a few years ago in carrgoraza , spain .
it began with a question of the mayor who came to us and said that spain and southern europe have a beautiful tradition of using water as part of the architecture .
and the question was , how could you connect technology , new technology with ?
and one of the ideas that was identified at mit in a work cycle was , imagine these tubes , and valves , magnetic valves , valves that open and close .
they create something like a water curtain with water spots .
if these images fall down , you can write on it , you can display patterns , images , text .
and you can approach him , and he ' s going to open up to let them jump , as you can see in this picture .
well , we introduced to mayor belloch .
he was very much .
and we got a commissioned to design a building at the entrance of the expo .
we called it the digital water pavilionvillium .
the whole building was made of water .
there are no doors or windows , but as you approach it , it ' s going to open and leave you in .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if it ' s windy , if you want to reduce the syringe , you can even let the roof down .
or you could close the building and the whole architecture will be , like in this case , you know , this day , when you walk down the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and saying , " you ' destroyed the building . "
no , they didn ' t destroy the building , it ' s just that architecture almost disappears .
here ' s how the building works .
you see the person wonder askinging what ' s going on inside it .
and here you see me , trying to testing the sensors that opened the water get wet .
now , i should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working .
but actually that night it was a even more fun .
all the children from zaragoza came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open to let them in , but a building that still had breaks and holes in the water , you now had to jump without getting wet .
and this was , very exciting for us , because as architects , as engineers , as designers , we always think about how the people who use the things that we design .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
and that ' s the beauty of creating things that are used and interacting with people .
so here ' s a picture of the building with the physical image points , the points of water and the projections on it .
and that ' s what made us think about the next project that i ' m going to show you now .
imagine these images could really start flying .
imagine if you could have little helicopters flying through the air , and each of them with a little image of view with varying light - almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here ' s the video .
imagine a helicopter like the one you saw you earlier , moving with others , completely synchronized .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this - a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or occasionally , in three dimensions where what changes is the light , is not the where of the points .
they can play with different kinds .
imagine in front of the screen could just appear in different formats or sizes , in different resolutions .
but then this could be just a 3d cloud of points that you can go through and through that you can move through , that you can see from many , many directions .
here you see a real flyfire controller that goes down to form a smooth v like before .
when you turn on the lights , this what it looks like this . so the way we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of by people is controlled .
every single image of image could have a impulse that comes from people , from the movements of people or something like .
i want to show you something first here .
we worked with roberto bolle , one of the best ballet dancers of our time - the iris at the metropolitan theater in new york and the scala in milan - we took his movements in 3d to use them as an impulse for the flyfire .
here you see roberto dancing .
on the left - hand side you see the images points , the different sensations are captured .
it ' s a real - time 3d scan and a motion capture .
so you can understand the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then once we have all the images points , you can play with it and play color motion with gravity and rotation .
we want to use that as a possible impulse for the flyfire .
i want to show you the latest project that we ' re working on .
it ' s something we ' re working on for the olympics .
it ' s called the cloud the cloud .
the idea is again , imagine that we ' re bringing people to do something and change the environment - almost what we call putting building clouds like you move a shadow gate , but with a cloud .
imagine everybody can give a small donation for a spot .
i think the remarkable thing of what s happened in last years , the last decades , is that we ' ve moved from a physical world to a digital world .
this has digitized everything , knowledge , and made it available through the internet .
today , for the first time - and the obama campaign has shown this - we can move from the digital world , from the self - organizing forces of networks to the physical world .
this can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
this is something built in the city .
but tomorrow it can be to face the challenges - think about climate change or co2 emissions - how can we go from the digital world to the physical world .
so the idea is that we actually engage people by doing things together , collectively .
the cloud is again a cloud of image points , in the same way that a real cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of image points .
it ' s a physical object in london , but ' s covered with image points .
they can move inside and have different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , share the most important moments for olympics 2012 and more beyond , and use it as a kind of connection to the community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to at top , like london ' s new mountaintop .
you can go in .
and a kind of digital boom at night - but most important , a new kind of experience for anyone who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i very important about the relationship .
through my work , i ' m trying to express that people are not separate from nature and that everything is connectednected .
the first time i was almost 10 years ago i was in antarctica , where i saw my first icebergs .
i attracted by awe .
my heart was swking , i was dizhzy as i was trying to grasp what was in front of me .
the icebergs around me raged almost 60 meters out of the water , and i could only wonder that was one snowflake on another snowflake year after year .
icebergs are born as a calf of a glacier or breaking out of ice sheets .
each iceberg has its own individual personality .
they interact clearly way with their environment and their experiences .
some people refuse to give up and cling to the bitter end , while some others don ' t stand it and collapse in a sense of dramatic passion .
when you look at an iceberg , you can easily think they ' re isolated , separate and alone , the as we humans often see .
but the truth is far away .
as an iceberg melts , i breathe its ancient atmosphere .
as the iceberg melts , it releases mineral - rich drinking water that feeds many life of life .
i think to in my photographs of these icebergs as i taking portraits of my ancestors , in aware that in these individual moments , they exist from this way and will never exist like that again .
it ' s not death when you melt ; it ' s not an end , it ' s a continue of their path along the life cycle .
some of the ice in the icebergen that i ' m photograph is very young - a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100 , 000 years old .
the last pictures i ' d like to show you are an iceberg that i photographed in cookoo tundraak in greenland .
very rarely you actually witnessing a rolling iceberg .
so here you see is it .
on the left - hand side you see a little boat .
this is about five meters long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg and where it is on the water line .
you can see here , he ' s rolling , and the boat moved to the other side , the man is standing there .
this is the average size of a greenland iceberg .
it reaches about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just like that , the iceberg shows you a different side of its his personality .
thank you .
my life is really extraordinarily blessed by working on some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing i ' ve ever worked on was this guy .
his name is tempt .
temp was one of the leading graffiti artists of the ' 80s .
then one day , he came back from walking and said , " dad , my legs bu . "
and that was the outbreak of the als .
temp is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i was facing him .
i have a company does design and animation , so graffiti is inevitably a complex part of what we admire and attention in the art world .
so we decided to support tony - tempt - and his cause .
i met with his father and his brother and said , " we ' re going to give you this money .
what are you going to do with it this ? "
and his brother said , " i just want be able to talk to tony again .
i just want to go back with him , and i said , " wait a minute , isn ' t that - i saw stephen hawking - can ' t all paralyzed people can communicate through these devices ? "
and he said , " no , it only if you ' re to the higher social class and you have a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
ordinary people , these devices are not available . "
and i said , " how do you communicate now ? "
anybody seen the movie " butterfly and dive bell ? "
this is how you they communicate - this is s how your fingers go along .
i was amazed , " very archaic , how can that be ? "
so i came with the need to just put a check , and instead i put out a check that i didn ' t have the slightest idea of how to file it .
i committed in place to his brother and his father - in the words , " well , my proposalion is this : tony ' s going to talk , we ' re going to get him a device , and we ' re going to find a way to him to make his art again .
because it ' s a farce that somebody who still carries all this them cannot communicate it . "
so i spoke a few months later i at a conference a months later .
i met these people from grl , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface , and then draw with a laser pointer on it that only detects the negative surface .
so they move around and do art displays like this .
they say that all the things that are shown up there follow a life cycle .
it starts with the gender lines , then comes the slogans , then the bush denlies , and finally people actually do art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
so i went home and i had at dinner with my wife and i told her about it , and we thought , " well , a second if there ' s this technology you to use your eyes to control things , then we should find a way that tempt can control a laser so that he can make graffiti again , which would be great . " . " so " so "
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of back and forth of things , we ' ve achieved some things .
first of all , we pushed the doors on the insurance , and actually got a device that it to communicate with temp - a stephen hawking machine .
that was incredible .
and he ' s really extremely funny - i call him yoda , because you talk to him , or you get an email , and you thinks , " i ' m so unthiious , this guy is incredible . "
we ' also deployedn seven programmers from all around the world - literally from all corners of the world - to us home .
my wife , my kids and i moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theory scientists and anarchists taken over our house .
a lot of our friends thought that we were stupid to do that , and that we came back and all the images on the walls were drawn graffiti .
but for over two weeks , we programmed , we went to the beach in venice , my kids got involved , my dog was also , and we created this .
it ' s called an eyewriter , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap sunglasse that we bought on the beach of venice , a little of copper wire and a some the things from the grocemarket store and the electronics business .
we took a ps3 camera , we drove it apart , we put it on an led light , and now we have a device that ' s free - you can build it yourself , we provide the code for free , the software can downloaded for free .
so we created a device that ' s completely free of constraints .
no insurance can get .
no hospital as either .
any paralyzed can actually communicate or draw with their eyes .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to tempers room .
i love this picture , because it ' s somebody else ' s room , and this is his room .
now there ' s all this riot before the big unveiling .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of programming , bowly and run nights , tony recorded for the time after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks beyond his life support system .
we raised his bed so he can see outside .
we put up a projector against a wall of the parking lot in front of the hospital .
and he drew again for the first time in the presence of his family and friends - and you can only imagine what a feeling that was in the parking lot .
funny thing , we also had to break into the parking lot , so we felt really like part of the spraying scene .
at the end of it , he sent us an email this text : " for the first time , i ' ve drawn something for seven years .
i feel like i ' ve pluueged underwater , and finally somebody pulled down and pulled my head up so i can breathe . "
isn ' t that overwhelming ?
this is something of like our fighting .
that keeps us engaged , and keeps us forward and further develop .
and we need to improve do a lot more better on this device .
it ' s an amazing device , but it ' s like a magic device .
and someone who has such a an artistic potential deserves so much more .
so we ' re trying to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we ' ve received all kinds of recognition .
we won a some awards .
remember , it ' s free , none of us deserve it .
it s all from our own pockets .
so the awards were , " oh , that ' s fantastic . "
armstrong twittered about us , and then , in december , time magazine awarded us as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
the coolest thing about this - and this opens the whole circle - that this april , when ' s launch moca in the inner city of los angeles , an exhibition called " art of the streets . "
and there will probably pretty the hardest representatives of the street art scene - banksy , shepard fairey , caws - all these guys will be there .
temp will be part of the show , which is pretty off .
so basically what i ' m talking about is , when you see something that ' s impossible , make it possible .
everything in this room was impossible - this stage , this computer , this microphone , the eyewriter - everything was eventually impossible at point .
make it possible - all of you here .
i ' m not a programmer , and i ' ve never had anything to do with eye vision technology before , but i ' ve just explored something and surrounded myself with amazing people so we could put something together .
and this question that each of you ask , every single day you notice that needs to be done , if not now , when ? and if not me , who else then ?
thank you .
so , i write for kids , and i ' m probably america ' s most read children ' s writer .
and i always tell people that i don ' t want to come like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer or leather , but nobody one s ever voted farmer .
today i want to tell you about circles and revelations .
well , an epiphaenny is usually something you find because you dropped it somewhere .
you go around the block and you take it as an revelationpha .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it - richard bollingbroke .
it ' s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you about today .
my circle started back in the ' 60s at high school in stow , ohio , where i was the class .
i was the one who was beaten the boys ' green and blue every week , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by letting me use the toilet in the teacher ' s room .
that ' s what she secretly .
she did it for three years .
and i had to get away out of the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it took me to san francisco , california - i found a lover - and back in the ' 80s , i found it important to do a job in aids organizations .
about three or four years ago , in the middle of the night , i got a phone call from this teacher , ms . postle , who said , " i have to see them .
i ' m sad that we ' ve never met each other as adults .
can you please come to ohio , and please come with the man i know you have found by now .
and i should mention that i have panlopatic cancer , and i want you to hurry up . "
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at her , we laughed , we cried , and we knew she had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them in , and we took care of them , and we took care of their family because it was needed .
it was something we knew to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to meet me as an adult , met me , she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands .
what had happened was that the circle had closed , it had become a circle - and the revelation i talked about showed .
the revelation is that death is part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that the rest of life .
he needs truth and beauty , and i ' m so happy that today this ' s been so mentioned so today .
he it he needs the same - he it needs dignity , love and pleasure , and it ' s up to us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion as you go up to 1 , 000 feet .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
imagine a engine that makes click , click , click , click , click , click , click .
that sounds fear intimidaghtting .
now , i had a unique place that day ; i was sitting on 1d .
i was the only one who could talk to the flying gearders .
so i looked at them in the same way moment , and they said , " no problem , we ' ve caught some birds . "
the pilot had already had turned the machine , and we weren ' t that far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot ordered the machine after the hudson river .
it ' s usually not the route .
it he turns off the engines off .
imagine a soundless airplane .
and then he said three words - the most emotionless words i ' ve ever heard .
he says , " ready for impact . "
i didn ' t have to talk to the crew anymore .
i could see it in her eyes , there was horror , life was over .
now i want to tell you three things that i learned about myself that day .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
we have this life plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to give a hand and didn ' t , all the fences that i wanted to fl , all the experiences i wanted to have and never have .
as i was thinking about it later , i came up with a phrase that said says , " i collect bad wines . "
because when the wine is there and the person is there , i open it up .
i never want to change anything difference in life .
and that urgency , that goal , really changed my life .
the second thing i learned that day - and that was when we were missed the george washington bridge , pretty much around hair - i thought , man , there ' s one thing i really regret .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i was looking for to get better in everything i tackle .
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego space .
and i regret the time i ' d wasted for meaningless things with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
and after that , thinking about it , i decided to remove negative energy from my life .
it ' s not perfect , but it ' s much better .
i didn ' t arguing with my wife for two years .
it feels great .
i ' m not trying to be right anymore ; i ' m going to be happy .
the third thing i learned - and that ' is as the inner clock starts ,ing , " 15 , 14 , 13 , . "
you see the water coming .
i said , " please fly in the air . "
i don ' t want this thing to break into 20 parts , as you know from documentary .
as we crash , i had that feeling of a human man is not terrifying .
it ' as like we ' re preparing our lives for it .
but it was very sad .
i didn ' t want to leave ; i love my life .
and that sadness really arose in a thought , which is that i only wish want one thing .
i just wish i could see my kids grow up .
about a month after that , i attended a show with my daughter s daughter - first graders , not a lot of artistic talent .
. not yet .
and i celebrate , i cry like a little kid .
and in the world , everything made a sense to me .
i realized at the time , by connecting the dots together that life is all about being a great father .
more than anything , anything else , my only goal in life is to be a good father .
i was given the miracle not dying that day .
i got another gift , which is to look into the future , and come back and live differently .
my call to anyone who ' s flying today is : imagine the same thing happens on your flight - please ' t - but imagine ; and how would you change ?
what would you do that they delay them because they you think they ' re there forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything , are you the best parents you can possibly be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the stuxnet computer worm , in itself , quite simple .
we don ' t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important position there for developing nuclear weapons is the uranium enriction plant in tata .
the gray boxes that you see here , these are real - time control systems .
now , if we can compecu with the systems that control rotations and valves , we can actually create a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don ' t run with windows software ; they ' re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can an effective windows virus on a laptop that ' s used by a maintenance engineer to configure this gray box , then we ' re in business .
and this is the planning behind stuxnet .
so we start with a windows dropper .
the user data is transferred into the gray box , damage the centrifuge , and the iranian nuclear energy program is delayed - mission .
this is a game , right ?
i want to tell you about how we figured this out .
when we started our research at stuxnet six months ago , it was t what the purpose and purpose of this project was .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated about terms of the windows part , the dropper part , it was used of thousands of zero - day vus .
and it seemed to do something with these gray boxes , these real - time control systems .
this attracted our attention , and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with stuxnet , and we studied this device .
and then something weird happened .
stuxnet was like a lab animal that didn ' t like our cheese - sniffing it , but didn ' t want to eat it .
that made make no sense in my eyes .
and after experimenting with various different kinds of cheese , i realized that this is a targeted attack .
completely focused on a particular target .
the dropper actively around the gray box when there s a special configuration has been discovered , even when the particular program that tries to infect it is trying to run on this target .
and if they doesn ' t , stuxnet doesn t does do anything .
so , that really got me interested , and we started working with it , almost 24 / 7 , because i thought , well , we don ' t know what the goal is .
it could be , say , for example , a u . s . power station , or a chemical plant in germany .
so we should better soon figure out what the goal is .
so we extracted and deco the attack code , and we found that it ' s structured into two digital warheads - a smaller one and a bigger one .
and we also noticed that they were very professionally designed by people who obviously had all the inside information available .
they knew all the bits and bits that they had to attack .
they probably even knew the size of the machine operator .
so they knew everything .
and if you ' ve realized that the dropper stuxnet is complex and high - tech , let me tell you , the user data is a science for themselves .
it ' s much more sophisticated than anything we ' ve ever seen .
here ' s a clipmpspt of this attack code .
we ' re talking about - about 15 , 000 lines of code .
it looks pretty much like old - fashioned execution language .
and i want to tell you how we were able to get smart of this code .
so the what first we first did looked was system function calls because we know what they ' re doing .
and then we looked for timers and data structures , and tried to connect them to the real world - potential targets in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could prove or disprove .
in order to establish these theories , we remember that it ' s definitely a high bomb , it ' s to be a high - quality target , and very likely it ' s in iran , because most infections have been reported there .
now , there aren are ' not several thousand targets in this area .
it ' s basically runs out to the bush nuclear power plant and to the uranium enric plant in nata .
so i said to my assistant , " bring me a list of all the in centrifuels plants and power plants experts from our client . "
and i called them up and i we tapged their knowledge to compare their expertise with what we had found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , we were able to connect the little digital warhead with the rotor controller .
the rotor is this moving part inside the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and if you manipulate the speed of this rotor , you ' re actually able to crack the rotor and eventually evenplode the centrifuge .
what we ' also found is that the goal of the attack was actually to make it happen slowly and scarbly - obviously in trying to the maintenance engineers desperate , so they would ' t be able to get behind it quickly .
the big digital warhead - we got a glimpse by looking at very closely at data and data structures .
so for example , the number 164 is very out of this code ; you can ' t miss it .
i started working through scientific literature about how these centritriees built in the , and found that they ' re structured in what we call cascades , and each car contains 164 centritriees .
so that made sense , it fit together .
and it got even better .
these centerstriees in iran are divided into 15 so - called levels .
and you guess what we found in the attack code ?
almost identical structure .
so again , this worked really well .
and this gave us great confidence for what we were studying here .
now , don ' t get me wrong , it didn ' t just work that .
these results were achieved by several weeks of hard work .
and we would often just run into a dead end and have to rec gatheruceelves .
anyway , what we found was that both digital warheads were actually targeted the same target , but from different directions .
the little warhead takes over a machcase , and it flips the rotors and slows them , and the big warhead interact with six cases and manipulates valves .
so , by and large , we ' re very confident that we ' ve actually predicted what the goal is .
it ' s butterflies , and it ' s just butterflies .
so we don ' t have to worry that other goals could be achieved by stuxnet .
here ' s something a really cool stuff that we discovered - really gotw me up .
down there is the gray box , and on top of it you see the centrifubes .
now , what this thing does is it detces the underlying levels of sensors - so for example pressure sensors and vibration sensors - and it provides legitimate code that still run during the attack with false input data .
and in fact , this false data from stuxnet is already recorded before .
so it ' s just like in hollywood movies , where during the chase , the surveillance camera is fed with previous recorded video footage recorded .
that ' s cool , isn ' t it ?
the idea here obviously is not just overturcoming the machine operators in the control room .
in fact , it ' s much more dangerous and more aggressive .
the idea is to oversh a digital security system .
we need digital security systems where a human machine operator can ' t react fast enough .
so in a power plant , for example , when the big steam turbine gets too fast , you have to open power valves within milliseconds .
of course , this cannot t be done by a human machine operator .
so at this point , we need digital security systems .
and if they ' re at risk , really bad things can happen .
the power station can explode .
and neither the machine engineers , nor the security system will notice it .
this is frightening .
but it gets worse .
and what i ' m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is generic .
it has nothing specifically to do with centrifuge , with uranium state enriction .
so for example , it would work just as well - in a power plant or in an automobile factory .
it ' s generic .
and you don ' t have to - as the attacker - don ' t have to put the user data through a usb key , as we saw at stuxnet .
you could also use ordinary worm technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as you can .
and if you do that , eventually you get a cyber weapon of mass destruction .
that ' s the consequence we have to face .
so unfortunately , the largest number of targets for these attacks are not in the middle east .
they ' re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the most challenging environments .
we have to face the consequences , and we start to prepare better .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , there ' s been a lot of reported that people think that the mossad is the main organization behind it .
is that your opinion as ?
okay , you really want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
in i my i opinion the mossad is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force behind this is the cyber superpower .
there ' s only one , and that ' s the united states - fortunately , fortunately .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you forsing us a lot . thank you ralph .
i ' ve spent the last few years putting myself in situations that are usually very difficult and kind of dangerous at the same time .
i went to jail - difficult .
i worked in a coal mine - dangerous .
i ' i filmed in war zones - difficult and dangerous .
and i ' spent 30 days eating nothing but eating this - fun at the beginning , a little difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i ' ve been exposed most of my career to of terrible situations , and all of this just for trying to study social importance in that they ' re compelling and interesting and hopefully in a way understand that makes them fun and accessible to the audience .
so when i knew i was going to come here to look a tedtalk at the world of branding and sponsoring , i knew that i was going to do something a little different .
some of you may have heard about the fact that weeks ago i put an ad on ebay .
i sent some facebook messages , some twitter messages , and i gave people the opportunity to create the names to my tedtalk in 2011 .
in really , some happy people and companies , for - profit and non - profit , got the unique opportunity - because i ' m sure chris anderson will never let that again - to buy the name of the talk that you ' re looking seeing at right now , which didn ' t have a title or a lot of content and not a lot of clues about what the subject would be . but .
so what you got was your name : my tedtalk , which you have no idea what the subject will be , and that would fly around your ears every per content , especially if i let your company standpid for your participation stupid .
but aside besides that , it ' s a very good media opportunity .
do you know how many people are looking at these tedtalks ?
a lot .
that , that ' s just the job title .
so despite this warning , i knew that anybody would buy the names .
now , if you asked me this a year ago , i wouldn ' t have been able to tell you this with certain .
but in the new project that i ' m working on , my new film , we ' re explore at the world of marketing , of advertising .
as i said , i ' ve over got some pretty terrible situations over the years , but nothing could prepare myself , nothing could prepare to go into room for something as difficult and as dangerous as going with these guys .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i want to do is a film about product placement , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by product placement , marketing and advertising .
and the film will be " the greatest movie ever sold . "
so what happens in " the greatest movie ever sold , " is that everything from top to bottom , from the beginning to end , is completelyged brands - the title sponsor you ' going to in the movie , which is the x .
now this brand , the philadelphia stadium , the staples center .
these people will be connected to the film eternal forever .
and so the film will explore this whole idea - that ' s what ? in eternity , forever ?
i ' m a redundant person .
that was more to emphasis .
it was " in eternity , forever . "
but we ' re not just going to have the x as a brand sponsor , but we ' re going to make sure that we ' re going to sell any category in the movie .
so we sell a shoe , and it will become the greatest shoe you ' ve ever worn .
the greatest car you ' ve ever driven from " the greatest movie ever sold , " the greatest drink you ' ve ever had , a attention from " the greatest movie ever sold . "
so the idea is , aside from showing that brands are part of life , really , get them to finance the movie ?
and we ' re actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you ' re going to see the whole thing going in the movie going from places .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i ' d be happy if ceg could help make this .
you know , it ' s funny because when i first heard it , it ' s the ultimate respect for the audience .
but i don ' t know how sick people are going to be .
do you have a perspective - i don ' want to use perspective , because that has a negative focus - but you know how this ' s going to evolve ?
how much money is it takes take to do that ?
1 . 5 million .
i think it ' s going hard to meet them , but i think it ' s definitely worth addressing some really well known brands .
who knows , when the movie comes out , we might look like a pack of idiots .
what do you think the answer will be ?
the answer will be most likely to be no .
but is it a hard thing for the movie , or a difficult thing for me ?
jk : both .
. so means , not that optimistic .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we have to think about what brands .
yeah .
if you look at the people you have dealing deal with .
there are some places we can turn to .
put the camera off .
i thought , " put the camera out " would mean that we wanted to have a background conversation .
it turned out that it meant , " we don ' t want to anything to do with your film . "
and just all these companies disappeared , one after another .
nobody wanted to have anything to do with the movie .
i was amazed .
they really wanted nothing to do with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising , was presenting your product to as many people as possible , let as many people as possible .
especially in the world today , at this intersection of new and old media and the fragmented media landscape - it ' s not the idea of being in this new exciting media tool that the masses is bringing this message .
no , that ' s what i thought .
but look see , the problem was that my idea had a fatal mistake , and that was the following .
actually no , that was wasn was t not the mistake at all .
that would have been a problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is for is a problem .
see , if you type transparency on the google search , that ' - this is one of the first images that appears appear .
i really like your kind , sergey brin . now .
that was the problem : transparency - free of deception and scarf , easy to explore and understand ; immediately understood ; characterized by visible and access to information , especially in terms of business practices - the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we ' re hearing a lot about transparency right now .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceos say it .
but when it comes to be implemented , something changes .
but why ? well , transparency is fear intimidating - like this weird bear who ' s still screaming .
it ' s unpredictable - like this strange highway .
and it ' s also very risky .
what else ' s risky ?
eat a whole bowl of cool whip .
that ' s very risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , " no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . "
see , when i was a kid and my father caught me lying - and there he ' s sitting looking at me with this look - he would say , " my son , there are three versions in each story .
there ' s your version , there ' s my version , and there ' s the real version . "
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real true version .
but because was only one company , an agency , was ready to help us - and only because i ' ve known john bond and richard kirshenbaum for years - i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to avoid the middleman and go right to with my team .
so what they suddenly began to understand - or what i began to understand - was that when you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood is a broad problem .
i have friends making big , gigantic hollywood movies , and i have friends make little independent movies like me .
and my friends who make big , gigantic hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners they have .
and then my friends who make small independent movies say , " well , how do we compete with these big , gigantic hollywood movies ? "
and the film is called " the greatest movie ever sold . "
so how exactly are we going to see ban in the movie ?
every time i get out my way , and every time i open the medical tube , you ' ll see an ban deodom .
and every time i interview someone , i can say , " are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you there ? you look a little nervous .
i want to help you calm down .
so maybe you leave you a little bit of this before the interview . "
and then we offer one of these great ods .
either floral fusion or a paradise winds , you ' ll have a choice .
we will be equipped for men and for women - solid , roll - on , or a stick , whatever .
this is the shorthand .
now i can answer all of your questions and give you a happy version .
we ' re a smaller brand .
just as you talked about the smaller films , we ' re a challenge as a brand .
so we don ' t have budget as other brands .
so doing these things - you know , reminds people of ban - that ' s kind of why we ' re interested .
what words would you describe ban ?
ban is blank .
that ' s a great question .
superior technology .
technology is not the way to describe something that someone is doing under their kns .
we ' re talking about aul , fresh .
i think " fresh " is a great word that really makes this category really makes it a positive , as opposed to " fight smell and moisture . "
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them longer fresh - better freshness , more fresh , three times fresher . ? .
these things have a more positive effect .
and this is a million company .
what about me ? what about the tab type ?
i have to talk to the man in the street who are like me , otto normal consumer .
you should to tell me a little bit about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmm , my brand ?
i don ' t know .
i really like beautiful clothes .
80 revival meets skateboardies , except on show day .
all right , what is the gerry brand ?
unique .
i think the genre , the style i have , is probably " dark glamour . "
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of gray colors , and of stuff like that .
but i usually have an equipment , like sunglasses , or a jewelry and stuff like that .
if dan was a brand , he would probably be a classic mercedes cab .
the brand i am is , i would say , fl fly .
part hippie , part yogi , part brooklyn girls - i don ' t know .
i ' m the charry type .
i sell grainuse all over the country worldwide .
so i think that ' s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
my brand is fedex , because i were a deliveriers .
brand named alcoholic addic writer .
can that done ? .
lawyer : i ' m a lawyer brand .
i ' m tom . i
now , we can ' t all be the tom brand , but i often see myself at the interface of dark glamour and lu fly .
and what noticed was that i needed an expert .
i needed somebody who could get inside my head , somebody who could really help me understand what ' s called " brand . "
and so i found a company called olson zalman in pittsburg .
they ' ve helped companies like nestle , misbrecher , hallmarkrow discover this brand .
if you could do it for them , you could help me .
they brought their pictures with me , right ?
i have . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how that is related to your thoughts and feelings about you .
these are the people who shape my worldview .
tell me about this world .
md : this world ? i think your world is the world you live in - like people around you , the friends , the family , the way you live your life , the work and so on .
all these things come and start from a place , and come for me , and they start with my family in west virginia .
what ' s the next thing you want to talk about ? . ?
next day . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
in what context does that about the thoughts and feelings about yourself ?
it ' s what i ' like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are queer . i like strange things .
tell me about the " why " phase - what does it do us ?
what is the machete ? what puppet stage are you in right now ?
why is it important to reboot ? what does the red mean ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little more about you , that ' not you .
what other metamorphs did you go through ?
. it doesn ' t have to be fear . what kind of rollercoaster are you in ?
ehee ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for your patience .
yeah . all right .
yes , i don ' t know what ' s going to going to happen .
there were a lot of crazy things going on .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their brand have two separate but different sides - the morgan trawlett brand is a mindful / playful brand .
they do very well .
and i think there ' s almost a contradiction with that .
and i think some companies will focus only focus on one strength , rather than both .
a lot of companies tend to - and this is human nature - to avoid things where that they ' re not sure , they ' re avoid fear , these elements , and that they welcome them welcome , and they actually turn them into something positive for themselves , and that ' s a clever game .
what other brands are acting like this ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can also see here , target , wii , mini by mini coopers and jetblu .
well , there are playful brands and mindful brands , these things that come and go , but a playful , mindful brand is a pretty strong thing .
a mindful , playful brand . what is your brand ?
if somebody asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand identity , how about you be ?
you have you a an up attrib ? are you something that puts the blood into wallss ?
or are they more of a down attribute ?
are you something that ' s a little quieter , more reserved , more conservative ?
up attributes are things that are playful , fresh like the fresh prince , modern , adventureurou , fancious and sweet like erol man , agile and agile , profane , dishes , magical and mystical like gandalf .
or are they more like a down attribute ?
are you mindful and moon like 007 ?
are they established , traditional , care , protective , compassionate like oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , familiar , safe , safe , sacred , thoughtful like the dalai lama or yoda ?
over the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies that were up and down companies who said " no " because they didn ' t want to be part of the project .
most of , they didn ' t want to do with this film , because they had no control , they , no control over the finished product .
but there would find 17 brand partners who were willing to avoidist this control , who wanted to do business with somebody as mindful and playful as i did , and that eventuallypowered us to tell stories we couldn ' t normally tell - stories that a adiser would never support .
they empowered us to tell the story of neuromarciing , as we tell the story in this film , that today we use mris to aim the pleasure centers of the brain , both to make advertising and make movies .
we went to sao paulo , where outsiderises has been banned .
in the city for , five years there s no ad , no poster , no posters , nothing .
and we go to school districts where companies are going their way to impoverished schools all over america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i got the most feedback , or where i had the greatest success , are the where i interacted with things directly .
and that ' s what these brands have done .
because they surrounded the middleman , they surrounded the agencies , and they said that maybe the agencies don ' t really have their interest in mind .
i ' m going negotiate with the artist directly .
i ' m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that makes people think that our worldview challenges .
and how what was that for them ? what was it succeed ?
now , since the film first launch at the sundance film festival , we can look at this .
according to burr , the premiere was in january , and since then - and this is not even the whole thing - there have were 900 million views from this film .
this actually just a period of two and a half weeks .
this is just online - no press , no tv .
the film hasn ' t been released yet .
it doesn ' t even online . there ' s no streaming .
he hasn ' t come out of other countries yet .
well , finally all , the film has gaineden a very huge momentum .
and that ' s not bad for a project where almost every ad agency we talked to has recommended their clients to get fingers rid off it .
one of the things that i believe in is that when you take your chance , you take risks that there are opportunities in those risks .
i think if you prevent people from doing , you get them closer to failure .
i believe that if you train your employees to avoid risks , you prepare the whole company to make a profit .
i feel that as we move forward , we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people not to be afraid of possibilities that might scare them .
finally , as we move forward , we should welcomece fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
welcome the fear . welcome the risk .
a big spoon of , so we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , brings us a little bit of honesty very far .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my whole talk , " welcome transparency " was presented to you by my good friends at emc who paid $ 71 , 000 for the names of ebay .
big data is being turned into big opportunities for organizations around the world .
emc : " welcome transparency "
thank you .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , this : what happened to the $ 71 , 000 ?
that ' s a great question .
i put a check in my pocket issued to the head organization of the ted organization , the sapling foundation - a 71 , 000 dollar to fund my ted show next year .
my name is amit .
18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i started to do something with museums and art , and my ceo , who ' is now today , gave me the green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i ' m going to focus on the performance .
there are a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and access .
i grew up in india .
i was given a great education - i ' m not complaining - but i had no access to many museums and those these works .
when i traveled and to these museums , i started learning a lot .
and while i was working for google , i tried to bring this desire - make art more accessible - with technology .
we then created a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i ' m probably going to start with the demonstration and tell you some interesting things that have happened since the launch .
so you just go to googleartpro . com .
you can look around all these museums here .
there ' s the uffizi , the moma , the hermita , the riks , the van gogh .
i actually come to one of my favorites , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get in two ways - very simple .
click , and boom , you ' re in this museum .
it doesn ' t matter where you are - bombay , mexico , it doesn ' t make any difference .
you go around and you ' enjoy yourself .
you want to orient yourself in the museum ?
open the card , and jump with a click .
they ' re in there , they want to go get to the end of the gang .
just on . lots fun .
googlee .
thank you , but the best part is .
so now i ' m in front of my favorite pictures , harvester worker by pieter brenegel at the met .
i see this pluse .
when the museum gave us the picture , click on it .
so this is one of the images .
this is all the metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here - but i ' m going click that away now .
this is one of the images we ' ve captured with what ' s called the gigaix technology .
for example , this image picture has about 10 billion points , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , " what do you get 10 billion images ? "
i ' m going to show you now .
you can zoom in and out very easily .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unprecedented .
but then they really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i realized something was going on there .
and i thought , " wait a minute , that sounds interesting . "
i went close , and slowly realized that these kids actually beatping something .
i did a little research , talked to some friends at the met , and i actually found out that it is a game called squail , where a geese is beaten fast with a stick .
it seems it was quite popular .
i don ' t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to really get close , you can go up to the cracks .
just to give you a sense of , i zoom in out so you can see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best part is comes - in a second .
let ' s jump to moma , again in new york .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
the previous example was about finding details .
but what if you want to see the strokes ?
and what if you want to see how van gogh actually made this masterpiece ?
you zoomed in . you can really go in .
i ' m going to zoom in one of my favorite parts of this picture until i really m on the cracks .
this is star night , probably never seen this before .
now i ' m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many others , but i don ' t have time .
that ' s the really cool part , it ' s called collections .
every of you , everybody - whether rich or poor , whether you have a great house - doesn ' t matter .
you can go out and create your own museum online - from all these images , you can create your own collection .
very simply , you go in - and i created this , which is called the power of the zoom - you can zoom around .
this is " the messenger , " in the national museum .
you can put everything in with comments , send your friends , and you start a conversation like about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think finally , the main thing that all the wonderful things here don ' t come from google .
they ' re not even come out of the museums , i think .
maybe i should not say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope that we ' ll deal with this digital medium of art , and represent it properly online .
and the biggest question i ' m asked recently is , " did you do this to replicate the experience of a museum visit ? "
the answer to that is no .
it should s meant to add the experience .
that ' s what it is about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a picture of your brain . your brain can be divided into two halves .
that s is the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the aptones of each hemisphere , we could represent their brain .
for example , this would be somebody who is completely logical .
this would be somebody who was completely intuitive .
now , where would you position your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have chosen decided one of these extremes , but i think for most people in the audience , your brain looks something like this - with a high aphetice that ' s at the same time in both hemispheres .
it ' s not as if they ' re both exclusive or anything like that .
they can be logical and intuitive .
and so i see myself as one of the people , along with most other experimental quantum physicists , who need a good amount of logic to put the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good degree of intuition to actually do the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
so we go out and play with it and then we see how it reacts , and then we start developing our intuition there .
they basically do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that they ' ve developed over the years is probably that one thing at the same time can only be in one place at the .
i mean , it can sound strange to think that a thing is at the same time in two different places , but they weren ' t born with this idea ; they developed it .
i remember seeing a kid playing on a ground threshold .
he was a little , and he wasn ' t very good at it , and he would falling all the time .
but i bet that playing with the ground tops taught him a very valuable lesson , which is that big things don ' t just let you pass , and that they stay in a one place .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world as long as you ' re not a particle physicist .
it would be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they don ' t play with ground thres waves , but they play with these little strange particles .
and when you play with their your particles , you find all sorts of weird things - like that fly directly through walls , or that at the time they can be in two different places .
and so they wrote all of these observations , and they called them the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; it needed quantum mechanics to describe the small , tiny particles .
but you didn ' t need them to describe the big everyday objects around us .
that didn ' t like my intuition , and maybe just because i don ' t play with particles so often .
well , i play with them sometimes , but not very often .
and i ' ve never seen them .
i mean , no one ' s ever seen a particle .
but my logical side didn ' t like it either .
because if all things are made of particles , and all these particles follow the rules of quantum mechanics , shouldn ' t just everything follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don ' t see a reason why that should ' t be that way .
so i would feel much better with the whole thing if we could somehow show that everyday objects also follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so a few years ago , i started to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that was in quantum mechanical superposition .
so what we ' re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal i ' m going to talk about in a moment .
this is a picture of the object .
here i ' m moving it a little bit . we ' re looking right in the center .
and here ' s a really , really big close - up of this little piece of metal .
so what we look at is a little piece of metal , it ' s shaped like a springboard , and it ' s just over the edge .
so i did this thing in a similar same way that you make a computer chip .
i went to a clean room with new silicon lamp , and i was crammed on all the big devices for 100 hours .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine - to get this like a swimming pool and this thing .
this thing has the ability to be in the quantum mechanical superposition , but it takes a little bit of help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , when i ' m alone in the elevator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people come in , and i stop listening doing all these things because i don ' t want to bother them , or frankly , terrife them .
so quantum mechanics says that unseen objects feel the same .
the riders for unseen objects are not just people , but also the light that shines upon them and the wind that sweeps past them and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically , we had to throw all the fellow .
and that ' s what we did .
we turned off the light , we put it in a vacuum , sucked out all the air and cooled it almost until the now , in the elevator , the piece of metal was free to behave as it wanted .
so we measured his movement .
we found that it ' s moving really strange .
instead of it just lying still , it vibrated . the way it vibrated was something of like this - like a expanding and intering structure .
by giving him a little push , we could make it to vibrate and not vibrate at same - something that is only allowed in quantum mechanics .
so what i ' m telling you is something truly fantastic .
what does it mean for an object time to and not vibrate at the time ?
let ' s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion of atoms that make up that piece of metal made are still there , and at the same time the same atoms move up and down .
only at precise times they agree .
the rest the time , they ' re deloralized .
that means that each atom is at the same time in two different places time , which at the same time that the entire piece of metal is in two different places .
i think that ' s really cool .
really .
that was worth putting me in the clean room for this year , because check that , the mass difference between a single atom and that piece of metal is about just same as the difference between the piece of metal and them .
so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , that piece of metal can be in two different places , why not you ?
i mean , that ' s just what my logical side says .
so , imagine you ' ve been the same time in multiple places at the time , what would that feel like ?
how would your consciousness deal with your body being deloralized in the space room ?
there ' s another aspect of history .
when we warmed it up , we turned the lights on and we looked at the box in , we saw that the piece of metal was always there in one piece .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are actually just quantum objects are put together in a small room .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says everything is connected to everything .
well , that ' s not quite right .
there ' s more to it , it ' goes even deeper .
it ' s that these connections , their connections with all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that ' s the profound and weird thing of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should re - the way we think about economic development .
it our goal should be is that , when families think about where they want to live and work , they ' re given them the opportunity to choose between at least a handful of different cities , all competing for new residents .
right now , we ' re far from this target .
there are billions of people in the developing world who don ' t even have a single city that you would welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they ' re worth so much more worth than it costs to build them .
so we could easily buildild the world very easily with dozen , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
now this may sound absurd to you , if you ' ve never thought about new cities .
just trade the building apartments against the building of cities .
imagine if half of the people who want to live in apartments have already done this ; but half the other half haven ' t yet .
they could try to expand the capacity for existing apartments .
but you know what you would engage into laws these apartments and their environment there are laws to avoid complaints and distract the growth .
so it turns out it ' s very hard to do all these extensions .
but you could go to a whole new place , build a completely new block of , as the laws there would support a building like this and not inhibit it .
so i proposed that governments will create new spaces that provide enough space for a city and i gave them a name : charter cities .
later what i found that , about the same time , ja and octavio were thinking about the challenge of reform in honduras .
they knew that about 75 , 000 hondurans leave their country every to move to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people could stay in their country and do the same in honduras .
at this point , ja said to octavio , " what happens if we take an uninhabitd area of our country - what if we just give it a message - a part of the american embassy , a part of the canadian embassy - and if people want to go to work under the canadian rules or the united states , can they work there , and they can do on the surface of those messages they would need to go to canada or america ? "
in the summer of 2009 , honduras suffered a severe constitutional crisis .
in the next planned elections , pepe lobo won in a shiftaro whose program offered both innovations and simct .
he asked octavio to become his head of .
in the meantime , i prepared for a talk at tedglobal .
through by improvement , by trial and through studying consumers , i ' ve been trying to reduce this complicated concept of charter city to into the key elements .
the first thing is the importance of laws , laws that govern say you cannot distur existing housing owners .
we pay lot a lot of attention to new technologies , but for it requires technologies and laws to progress , and it ' s usually laws that keep us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of from guatemala named octavio sent the link to the tedtalk .
the one he showed him ja .
they called me .
and they said , " let ' s present this to the head of our country ! "
so we met in december at the auditorium of a hotel in miami .
i ' ve tried to showust out how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and i used this graph to show you how valuable raw land is in a place like new york . remember , area in some cases is per square meter is worth thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at a time when there was a pause , octavio said , " paul , maybe we could look at the tedtalk . "
so the tedtalk , in a very simple way form , that a charter city is a place whose beginning is uninhabited land , a founding contract that sets the laws that rule there and gives people the opportunity to decide either to live under those rules or not .
so i was asked by the president of honduras , who said that we need to do this project , that it ' s important , and that this is the way to move our country forward .
i was asked to come to tegucigalpa and give a talk again on the fourth and fifth january .
so i gave another facts filled talk that included a graph like this , which tries to illustrate that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city of denver , and the sketch represents the new airport that was built in denver .
these airport alone has 100 square kilometers .
so i tried to convince the honingoians , that if you want to build a new city , you have to start with an area at least 1 , 000 square miles .
that ' s more than 250 , thousand morning .
politely , everybody applaud .
the audience ' s faces were very serious and alert .
the head of congress came up the stage and said , " professor romer , thank you very much for having your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i have it here on my laptop . "
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i ' ve come to the point proposition that a new city offers new opportunities to people .
there would be a opportunity to live in a city that would be in honduras , rather of hundreds of miles in the north .
and a new city also includes new opportunities for leaders .
the leaders of the government in honduras dependd on the help of partners countries , they could benefit from their partners who would support setting the laws for this charter and making this process that everybody can trust that the charter really implemented .
and the realization of president lobo was that the certainty of the participation that i ' ve been thinking about as a way to get foreign investors and build this city could be equivalent to all the parties in honduras who have been suffered suffering from fear and mistrust for many years .
we went to an area .
this picture is from this place .
it a thousand square kilometers .
and shortly after that , on january 19th , they voted at congress for to change the constitution to have a constitutional policy that ' s allowed for special developing areas .
in a country that has just had a severe crisis , 124 vote in congress was voted elected for this reform with 124 .
all parties , all the sectors of society , supported this .
in to be part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice by congress .
on february 17th , it was approved for the second time with 114 to a vote .
right after this election , between february 21 and february 24 , a delegation of about 30 dog dogss traveled to the two places the world who were most interested in entering the business of urbanism .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big new center built in south korea - bigger than the of boston .
everything you can see in this picture was built within four years after took four years to get the permissions .
the other place that was very interested in urbanism is singapore .
there have been two cities built in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you think about it practically , that ' s where we are today .
they already have a construction site , and they ' re already considering this area for the second city .
it ' s already working on a legal system that allows managers to participate , and it ' s also working on an external legal system .
a country has already offered to provide its supreme court as a court for the discoorant appeal of the legal system there .
urban designers and farmers are very interested .
they even bring funding .
one thing , as you already know , has been solved , there ' s a lot of rent .
there are a lot of businesses that would like to move in america , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there are a lot of people who would like to live there .
there are 700 million people around the world who say that they want to live permanently in another place .
a million people leave latin america every year and migratingrated to the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to leave their families to look for work - sometimes they ' s re single mothers who have to earn enough money to afford food and clothing .
unfortunately , sometimes it ' s even children who are trying to find their parents that who , in some cases , haven ' t seen them for a decade .
so what is it an idea to think about building a whole new city in honduras ?
or even building dozen of these cities , or hundreds spread around the world ?
so what is it an idea to insistng that each family has a choice between multiple cities competing with new residents ?
that ' s an idea worth spreading .
my friends from honduras asked me to say , thank you ted .
do you know how many decisions you make on a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
i recently did a survey of over 2 , 000 americans , and the average number of decisions that seem makes a typical american a day is 70 .
also , there was also a study recently with ceos where they watched the ceos for a week .
and these scientists have just documented the various topics that these ceos were dealing with , and how much time they spent making decisions relate to the topics .
and what they found was that the an the average ceo is dealing with 139 tasks a week .
each of these topics , of course , were of many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
it took about 12 percent of their decisions , they took an hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you make in the nine - minute category versus those in the one hour category ?
how well do you think are you at making the decisions ?
today i want to talk about one of the greatest decision - making problems in our modern time , the decision - making problem .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i ' m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
when i ask you a question , because i ' m blind , just raise your hand if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i ask you if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question for today is : are you willing to hear about the decision - problem ?
thank you .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very exclusive foodoce store ; at least the time it was really exclusive .
it was a store called larry ' s .
this business , it was almost like an amusement park .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and acid and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water - and this was at a time when we actually drinking pipe water .
i loved to go to this store , but at a point i wondered myself , well , how come you never buy anything ?
here ' s the olive oil gang .
they had over 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those ones that were locked in boxes that came from thousands thousand of - years of old olive trees .
so one i decided to visit the grry store one , and i asked the leiter , " does this model work that you really give people all these opportunities ? "
and he pointed at the bus tickets of tourists who came every day and usually had their cameras with them .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose marble for our experiment .
here ' s her flame walking .
they had 348 different kinds of marble .
we set up a little clean wall right at the entrance of the business .
we put six different tasteavorss of musta or 24 different flavors of musta there , and we looked at two things : first of , which case would more people stop and try chocolate ?
there would will be more people left standing there when they were 24 , about 60 percent , than if they were six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at which case people more likely to buy a glass of paint .
now we saw the reverse effect .
of the people who stopped when they were 24 , only three percent them actually bought a glass of paint .
of the people who stopped when they were six , well , we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of paint .
now , if you calculate the math , people bought six times more of a glass of marble , if they had six choose than if they had 24 choose .
now , deciding not to buy a glass of soap is probably good for us - at least it ' s good for our wai - but it turns out that the decision - making problem also affects us when very consistent decisions .
we don ' t decide to decide , even though it are against our own best interests .
so the theme of the day is financial savings .
now i ' m going to describe you a study that i did with gur huberman , emir kamenica , wei jang , where we looked at the decisions on for the retirement of nearly a million americans from about 650 plans in the united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of offers that could possible to a retirement savings plan , the 401 plan , which affects the odds of more is more for tomorrow .
and what we found was that actually fact , there was a connection .
so in these plans , we had about 657 plans that offered people anything between two to 59 different funds .
and what we found was that the more funds were offered , in fact , the rate of participation rate was less .
now , if you look at the extremes , the plans that offered two funds had a participation rate in the ' 70s - still not as high as we want .
in the plans that offered almost 60 funds , the participation rate now fell to about the 60 percentage .
now it turns out that even when they decide to participate , if were more options choose , even then it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided tend to that the more opportunities they were available , the more they avoid taking stocks and funds .
the more opportunities they were , the more they put all their money into pure money market accounts .
none of these extreme decisions are one of the decisions that someone of people would recommend if we care about their future financial well - being .
now , in the last 10 years , we ' ve seen three major negative consequences in humans that bring offering more and more choices .
they push the decision - put push them up , even if it comes against their own best interest .
they make more worse decisions - worse financial decisions and worse medical decisions .
they choose more things that they make re less happy themselves , even if they make it objectively better .
the main reason for this is that maybe we might enjoy looking at these huge shelves full of lemonade , mustard , acid and lemon , but we can ' t actually make the comparisons and differences and then actually choose something out of the fantastic offer .
so what i want to suggest to you today is four simple techniques - techniques that we ' ve tested in different ways and different research places - that you can just apply in your business .
first of all , limit .
you ' ve heard it before , but it ' s never more true than today that there ' less more .
people are always worried when i say , " limita . "
they ' re always worried that they ' re losing shelves .
but in fact , we ' re seeing it more and more , that if they ' re willing to limit , and get rid of the irrelificant opposite possibilities , well , there ' s a rise in sales , there ' s cost , & amp ; and there ' s a improvement in decision - making .
when proctor and gamble reduced the different head and shoulder from 26 to 15 , they saw a increase in sales by 10 percent .
when the golden cat corporation rided its 10th 10 worst selling cat violation , they saw that the profits went up 87 percent - a result of both , the increase in sales and reduction of cost .
you know , the average supermassive today offers you 45 , 000 products .
a typical wal - mart offers you 100 , 000 products today .
but the ninth largest supermarket , today ninth largest supermarket in the world today is aldi , and they only provide them 1 , 400 products - a kind of tomato sauce in cans .
now in the world of saving , i think one of the best examples that ' s recently come out to market about how to best manage the choices was something that david laibson has contributed very lot involved in , which ' s a program that ' s offered at harvard .
every single harvard employee is now automatically participating a life fund .
those who really want to make a choice are offered 20 funds , not 300 or more funds .
you know , as people often say , " i don ' t know how to limit it .
it are all important possibilities . "
and the first thing i ask the employee question is , " tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if their employees can ' t keep them apart , their customers can ' t . "
now , before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he was ready to offer all the people in this audience an all - inclusive paid vacation to the most beautiful street in the world .
here ' s a description of the street .
and i ' d like to read them .
and now i ' m going to give you a few seconds to read them , and then i ' m going to ask to clap if you ' re ready to take gary ' s offer .
okay . anyone who ' s willing to accept gary ' s offer .
are they all ?
all right , let me show you a little bit more of that .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
now , who ' s ready for this journey . ? .
i think maybe i ' have ve heard more hands .
all right .
in fact , objectively looked at you had more information for the first time than the second time , but i would dare to guess they got it more real the second time .
because the images made it feel more real for them .
which brings me to the second technology that helps you deal with the problem of decision - making , which is concreteization .
it ' s about people , in order to understand the difference betweenbilities , people need to understand what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that those consequences need to be vivid and concretely felt .
why do people spend on 15 to 30 percent more when they use a eb card or a credit card than they do with cash ?
because it doesn ' t really feel real money .
and it turns out that if you make that something feels concrete , it ' s a very good tool to get people to save more .
so in a study that i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro previtero , we did a study with the people at ing - employees who all worked for ing - and these people were all in a meeting where they signed up their participation for their retirement savings plans .
and during this meeting , we kept this meeting just the as it has always been , but we added a little bit .
the little thing that we put in it was that we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they saved money .
in by doing this simple thing , there was a increase in participation by 20 percent , and there was a increase in the number of people who were willing to save , or a increase four percent increase in the amount they were willing to pay for the savings account .
the third technology : categorization .
we can better deal with more categories than with more choices .
for example , here ' s , a study we did in a magazine .
it turns out that in the wegman ' s supermarkets in the top and down in the northeast area , the number varies between from 331 different kinds of magazines up to 664 magazines .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines and i divide them into 10 categories , or i show you 400 magazines , and i split them into 20 categories , you think i ' given you more choice and a better select experience than i had gave you the 400 than if i had gave you the 600 .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
here are two different jewelry types .
one is called jazz , and the other one is called swing .
if you think that the left display is swing and the display on right is jazz , you clap your hands .
okay , there are a few .
if you think that the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing , please clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they ' re right .
the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing , but you know what ?
this is a very unutiessazed categorization param .
the categories have to tell the winnerer something , not the who provides the choice .
and this problem you often see this problem when you look at the long lists of all these funds .
who do you really want to inform about this ?
my fourth technology : premise of complexity .
it turns out that we can actually deal with more information than we think we just need to do simplify it .
we need to slowly increase complexity .
i ' m going to show you an example of what i mean .
let ' s take a very , very complicated decision : buying a car .
here ' s a german car manufacturer who that offers you the opportunity to self -figure your car completely .
you have to make 62 different decisions to completely design your car completely .
now these decisions differ in the number of choices they offer per choice .
car colors , outside color of the car - i have 56 possibilities .
motors , gears - four pos options .
what i ' m doing now is i ' m changing the order in which the decisions occur .
half of the customers go from the many pos options , 56 car colors to the low possibilities , four gears .
the other half of the customers go from the low possi , four gears to the 56 car colors , many pos options .
what do i look at ?
how interested you are .
if you keep use the standard choice on the decision , it means you ' re overwhelmed , which is i ' lose it .
what they find is that the people who go from the many to the low choices over and over choose the standard choice .
we lose them .
go from the low - choices to the many , then stay with it .
it ' s the same information . it ' s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i ' ve done is change the order in which this information is presented .
when i start with the simple one , i learn how to choose .
even though the gear choose , doesn ' t tell me about my preferences for the interior , it still leaves me to choose .
it also gets me excited about the big product that i ' m putting together , and so i ' m ready to get myself motivated to be with interest in it .
let me wrap up .
i ' ve told you about four techniques that minimize the problem of decision - making - limita them - get rid of the unnecrupt alternatives ; concrete it - make it real ; categorize - we can better deal with more categories , fewer opportunities , ; prepare for complexity .
each of these techniques that i ' m describing you about you today is designed to help you manage the possibilities - good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for the people you provide service .
because i think that the key to the best choice is that you ' re selectivey when choose choice .
and the more we are selective in choiceosing , the better we ' re going to be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i ' m kevin allocca , trends manager at youtube . , i look at youtube videos .
that ' s true .
today we want to talk about how videos become viral , and then why this is important .
we all want to be stars - celebrityties , singers , comedians - when i was young , it seemed so infinitely difficult .
but web videos have allowed us all , or all of our creative activities to become incredibly famous in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about over the internet until the next saturday .
but on youtube , more than 48 hours of video per minute is uploaded .
again , only a tiny percentage this ever becomes viral and is seen at thousands of times and the cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : tastemaker , participation organizations and the unexpected .
well , let ' s go .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god ! oh
whoa !
ohh , woww !
last year , bear vasquez sent this video he had filmed in of his house in yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it had been seen 23 times seen .
this chart shows what it looked like when the video first became popular last summer .
actually , bear didn ' t want to a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you just do that when you ' re called yosemite mountain bear .
he hadloaded a lot of natural videos .
and this video had actually been sent in january .
what happened here ?
there was jimmy kimmel .
jimmy kimmel sent the tweet that ended up making the video so popular .
because tastemakers like jimmy kimmel present us new and interesting things and show them to a big audience .
it ' s friday , friday . let gotta get down on friday . everybody ' s looking forward to the weekend , weekend . friday , friday . gettin ' down on friday . you didn ' t think we were re going to have this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
rebecca ' " friday " is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it ' s seen at almost 200 million times this year .
this is what the chart looked like .
just like " double rainbow , " it seems to come out of nowhere .
what happened that day ?
well , it was friday , that ' s right .
if you want to know , these other peakss are also friday nights .
but what about that day , that particular friday ?
now , tosh . 0 gave up , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
michael j . nelson from the mystery science theater was the first person to make about a joke on twitter .
what ' s important is that a single person or a group of tastemakers took a position , shared with a large audience , and accelerated the process .
then this community of people who shared this big inside joke and started talking about it and playing around with it .
now there are 10 , 000 quotations of " friday " on youtube .
even in the first seven days , there was a quotation for every single week .
unlike the loneed conversation of the 20th century , community is our way to become part of this phenomenon - either by spreading it or making something new out of it .
" nyan cat " is animation and music in endless .
that ' s it , very simple .
this year , it was seen almost 50 million times .
and if you think that ' s crazy , you should know that there ' s a three - hour version of this that ' s been seen four million times .
even cats watch this video .
cats look at cats watching this video .
what important thing is the creativity that exists in the internet culture of techies and geeks .
there were remixes .
somebody made an old - fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole remix community shot out of the ground , made it from a stupid joke to something that we can all participate in .
today , we don ' t just find pleasure to something , we do with it .
who could have predicted all this ?
who could have predicted " double rainbow " or rebecca black or " nyan cat ? "
what scripts could you have written in which this in ?
in a world where is two days of video is uploaded every minute , there can only really unique and unexpected as the video i mentioned about .
i admit , i wasn ' t very interested when a friend of mine me i should watch this great video about a guy protesting in new yorking tickets for bicycles .
i got a ticket because i didn ' t ride on bike , but often there are disability that don ' t let you be properlyent walk on bike .
because this was completely surprising and humorous , casey stolchert ' s funny idea and his argument was looked at five million times .
this approach is app true of everything that we do creatively .
and all of this leads to the one big question .
what does that mean ? what .
oh .
what does that mean ? what .
taste makers , creative participants , completely unexpected , are the features of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to and which the audience determines popularites .
as i said , one of the biggest stars - justin bison - started on youtube .
nobody has to give your green light to ideas .
and today we all feel as owners of our pop culture as well .
and these are not the features of old media , and they hardly affect today ' s media , but they will determine the entertainment of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk in 10 minutes about the connection between women over three generations , and how the amazing strength of that connection manifested in the life of a four - year - old girl when she sat sitting with her little sister , her mother and grandmother for days in a little boat in the chinese sea over , a connectionnec connection that stuck in this little girl ' s and never disappeared - this little girl who now living in san francisco and speaks speaking to you today ? living this girl ?
the story isn ' t over yet .
it ' s a puzzle that ' s still being put together .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzle pieces .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his life .
he ' s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life was held by the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home .
keep him in the invasion of the communists in saigon , as how he has to admit that his life had been a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , now reso lauled his him .
he went back to silence .
he died , broken by the story .
he ' s my grandfather .
i ' ve never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
i had to make sure that it wasnn ' t free , and my job was to learn that history story was trying to crush us , but we survived it .
the next piece of the puzzle shows how a boat walkingly on sea in early the morning .
my mother , may , was 18 when her father died - already in an arranged marriage , already with two little girls .
for her , life had asked her a task : her family ' s escape and a new life in australia .
it was completely excluded that she could fail at it process .
after a four - year old and film - telling saga , a boat lay silent still on the sea , diveged as a fishing boat .
all adults were aware of the risks .
they were most afraid they were of pirates , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother had a little poison bottle with her .
in a captivity , first my sister and i had , then she herself and my grandmother had drank from it .
my first memories are about this boat - the steady shoping of the engine , the clapping of every wave on the front , the vast and empty horizon .
i don ' t remember the pirates that came many times , but were because by the death nose of men on our boat , or the wreck of the engine that didn ' t want to start for six hours .
but i remember the lights of the oil platform off the malay coast , and the young man who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first apple that one of the men on the platform gave .
no apple has ever tasted that way .
after three months of in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next puzzle of puzzle is about four women in three generations building together building a new life together .
we settled down in footscray , a working - class neighborhood , whose population is of immigrant families .
unlike the old - fashioned middle - class suburbs , whose i was completely nobody know to existence , in footsc , there was no challenging doubt .
the smells from the shop doors came from the rest of the world .
and the fat broken english were traded between people who had one thing in common : they started again .
my mother worked on farms , then on a assembly line in a car factory , six days , double layers .
she somehow found the time to learn english and it skills .
we were poor . we
every dollar was assigned and put into another education for english and math , no matter whatever we had to avoid after . most of the time , these were the new things , they were always from secondhand .
two few underts for school , each one to cover the holes in the other .
a school uniform up to the toeghs , because it had to stretch six years .
and there were the rare but painful choirs of " closed wives , " and there murals here there : " asians , go home . "
home where ?
something grew inside me .
there was a meeting of reconciliation , and a quiet voice said , " i ' m going to get out of the way . "
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other about our day , and we listened to the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered from nightmares from the boat .
and my job was to stay awake every night until their nightmares came so i could wake them up .
she opened a computer shop , then graduated a cosmetic education , and then opened another business .
and the women came with their stories about men who didn ' t tole the change , angry and inefficient and sorrow children trapped between two worlds .
loans and sponsors were looking for .
centers were built .
i lived in parallel worlds .
in one of them i was the classic asian student who challenged irntificaing demands on himself .
in the other , i was involved in uncertain lives wearing tragic scars of violence , drug abuse and isolation .
but so many got help over the years .
and because of this help , in my last year of law , i was chosen as a young australian of the year .
and i was takened from one puzzle to the next catapult , and the edges didn ' t fit together .
tan le , anonymous residents of footscray , was now tan le , refugee and social activist who was invited to speak to places she had never heard of , and in homes whose she could never imagined existence .
i wasn ' t not familiar with the label .
i didn ' t know how to use the bres .
i didn ' t know how to talk about wine .
i didn ' t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the conveniness of life of an unknown suburb - a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who have left closed each of their days as for 20 years by telling the stories of their day reading other still in the same bed .
i told my mother , i couldn ' t do it .
she reminded me that i was now as old as you was when we climb the boat .
no had never been an opportunity .
" just do it , " she said . " and don ' t be what you ' re not . "
so i talked about unemployment and education and neglect of the marginalized and disenfraned .
and the more open i spokeed , the more i should talk .
i met people in all the milieus , so many of them did what they loved , lived at the limits of possible .
and even though i graduated from graduate school , i realized that i couldn ' t deal with a career in law career .
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
and i realized at the same time that it ' s okay to be an outsider , a newcomer , new in the picture - and not just okay , but something you have to be grateful about , maybe a gift of the boat .
because listening to can be so easily to the collapse of the horizons can be so easy that you accept the assumptions of the environment .
i ' ve gone enough out of my conveni to know that , yes , the world is dis apartingng , but not the way you fearpect .
opportunities that had not been allowed were explicitly encouraged .
there was an energy , an unsrelpectt optimism , a strange mixture of humility and gui .
so i followed my gut reaction .
i gathered a small team of people around me for whom the box " can ' t " was an compelling challenge .
for a year , we didn ' t have a cent .
at the end of every day , i cooked a giant pot of soup that we shared .
we worked late at night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but there were some brilliant about it , and we made the breakthrough .
i made a decision to move to the united states .
after just one journey there .
my gut reaction again .
three months later , i moved , and the adventure continued on .
before i leave the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when confucian was the social norm and the local mandarin was the most important person .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died just after she was born .
her mother raised her alone .
at 17 , she became the second woman of a mandarin whose mother beat her .
without the support of her husband , she created a sensation by bringing him to court and being a prose in her own case , and a an even greater sensation when she won .
" can ' t " turned out to be false .
i was bathing in a hotel room in sydney when she died 1 , 000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the shower window and i saw her standing on the other side .
i knew she had come to say goodbye .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in footscray and we sat around their sarg .
we told her stories and assured her we were still with her .
at midnight , the monk came and said he had to close the cosum .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , " why is her hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? "
" because they ' ve been them this morning , " he said .
" they didn ' t let them go . "
if there ' s a band in our family , it goes through the women .
if you can see who we were and how life shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives had come in the way of us .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i ' d like have my own kids , and i ' m still thinking of the boat .
who would ever wish one ?
yes , i ' m afraid of privilege , of ease , of legal .
can i give you a bug in your life that bravely defies every wave , the unwanted , consistent warks of the engine , the long horizon that gua 'rantee anything ?
i don ' t know .
but if i could give this and could do it , i would do it .
also , tan ' s mother is also here in the fourth or fifth row .
i ' m here to share my photography with you .
is it even photography ?
because this is , of course , is a picture you can ' t take with your camera .
yet , my interest in photography began when i got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
i combined it with my previous preference for drawing , but it was a little different , because when using the camera , the process was more in planning .
and when you take a picture with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
so for me , photography seemed more about being in the right place at the right time .
i thought everybody could do that .
so i wanted to create something else , something where the process begins , when the trigger is printed .
pictures like this : a construction site along a much - traffic road .
but it has an unexpected turn .
and still keeps a realistic level .
or photographs like this - dark and colorful at the same time , but all with a the common goal of maintaining a realistic level .
when i say reality , i mean photo - reality .
because , of course , it ' s not something you can really capture , but i always want to make it look like it could have had it in a photograph .
photographs where you have to think for a brief moment to figure out the trick .
so it ' s more about captureturing an idea than really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it about the details or the color ?
is it about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it ' s how we interpret the world , and how it can be wiible on a two - dimensional surface .
it ' s not about what ' s realistic , it ' s what we think is realistic .
so i think the foundationss are very simple .
i see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect imaginable physical objects that we can all relate to in a three - dimensional world .
but combined in a certain way , you can create something that still looks three - dimensional , as if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that ' s not possible .
so we re overlooking our brains , because our brains simply don ' t accept that it doesn ' t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combining photos .
it ' s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that make a picture look realistic , i think it ' s the things we don ' t think about , the things around us in our everyday lives .
but when we combine photographs , it ' s really important to think about it , because otherwise they just look kind of wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
as you can see , these are not three special pictures .
but combined , you can create something special like this .
so the first rule is that combined photographs should have the same perspective .
second , combined photographs should have the same type of lighting .
and these two images meet these two demands - shot from the same altitude and the same lightingumi type of lighting .
thirdly , it ' s about making it impossible to distinguishing where the individual images start and end by connecting them seamlessly .
makes it impossible to say how the photo was actually put together .
so by applyting color , contrast and brightness at the edges of the individual images , adding photographic lackruption , like field depth , satuined colors and disturban , we narrow the boundaries between the different images and make them look like a single photograph , even though an image can basically contain hundreds of layers .
here ' s another example .
you might think that this is just a landscape , and the bottom part has been manipulated .
but this picture is actually completely composed from of photos from different places .
personally , i think it ' s easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don ' t have to compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that it took me several months to plan to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been caught on a fishing flight .
the bank comes from another place .
the underwater part is from a quarry .
and yes , i even changed the house up the top of the island red to make it look swedish .
so to a realistic result , from me , it ' s beyond on planning .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
after that , it ' s about combining the different images .
and here ' s every piece is very well planned .
and then when you make good photographs , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also pretty realistic .
so there are all the tools there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
thank you .
i ' d like to talk to you about why so many electronic health projects are missing .
and i think the most important point about this is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things that we introduced at radboud university was we to hire a main listener .
it ' s not particularly scientifically - she puts a cup of coffee or tea and asks the patients , families , the relatives , " how are it ?
how can we help you ? "
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems why everybody - maybe most of the electronic health projects fail : because we ' ve stopped listening .
this is my wireless scale . it ' s a very simple thing .
it has a button , on / off .
and every morning i jump on it .
and yes , i have a task , as you may recognize .
i ran my job at 95 lbs .
it works very simple : every time i jump on the scale , it sends my data to google health as well .
and they ' re also taken there by my general doctor , so he can see where my weight problem is , not just the moment i need cardiolc support or something , but also with looking at the past .
but there ' s something else .
you might may know with that i have over 4 , 000 twitter users .
so every morning , i jump on my wireless meter , and people are talking to me before i ' m in the car , " for lunch , pre a little salad today , lucy . "
but that ' s the nicest thing that can happen , because this is the group pressure , group pressure to help patients , because this could be used for obesity , or it could get patients from smoking .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and to get them to play some kind of game together to better control their health .
next week , this comes out to the market .
there ' s going be this little blood pressure meter device that you plug to an iphone or something .
and it will enable people to measure their blood pressure at home , send it to their doctor , and share it with others , for example , for something like 100 dollars .
at this point , the patients come in . not only can they take in control , be captains on their own ship , but they can also help us health care in the challenges that we face , and the cost explosion of health care , double demand , and so on .
do techniques that are easy to use , and start this to hug patients in the team .
and you can do that through these techniques , but also through crowdsourcing .
and one of the things we ' ve done is i want to share with you through a quick video .
we have all the guidance systems in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know exactly where all the atms around maastricht are .
we know another thing where all the gas stations are .
and yeah , we can find fast food chains .
but where would the next kind be to help this patient ?
we asked around , and nobody knew .
nobody knew where the next life - saving ae was to find at that moment .
so , what did we do ? we did crowdsourcing in the netherlands .
we set up a website and we asked a crowd people , " if you see an aed , please share with us where he is , when he died , " because sometimes it ' s closed during business time , of course .
and over 10 , 000 ae have been reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for this .
and we designed an ipad app .
we developed an app for layar , augmented reality , to find these aeds .
and if you ' re in a city like maastricht and someone collapses , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks use your microsoft cell phone to find the next pc that can save lives .
and from today , we want to introduce this , not just as aed4u , what the product is called itself , but also as aed4us .
and we want to take this to a global level .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universities , to help us behave like nodes , to crowdsource these ae around the world .
and when you ' re on vacation and someone collapses , whether it ' s your own relative or somebody else , you can find an alternative like this .
the other thing we want to ask about is that companies around the world are helping us confirm these ones .
these could be courierers , or technicians , for example , just to make sure the registered ae is still in its place .
please help us do that and try to improve health not just , but take it hands .
thank you .
today i ' m going to tell you about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the solar technology industry .
and my little startup wants us to push ourselves face environment by .
. it gives attention to crowdsourcing .
here ' s a short video of what we do .
oh . a moment .
it might take it to be loaded .
now - we can just skip that - instead i ' m just going to skip the video .
no .
that ' s not .
okay .
solar technology is .
oh , my time ' is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year break and work in an environment that s pretty much everything they actually hate , and we had them work in government .
the program is called code for america , and it ' s a little bit like the peace program for computer nerds .
we choose some fellows every year , and we let them work with city authorities .
instead of sending them to the third world , we send them into city hall .
and there they developed great apps , worked with urban employees .
but what they ' re really doing is show what ' s done with technology today .
so meet al .
al is a fire hydrant in boston .
here it looks like he ' s looking for a date , but what he ' s really looking for is somebodying him out when he ' s frozen in , because he knows he ' s not very good at fire when he ' s covered off a meter of snow .
how did he get look for help in this particular way ?
we had a team of fellows in boston last year during the code for america program .
they were there in february , and it did a lot last february .
and they realized that the city never holds these fire hydrants .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik michaels ' - head , noticed something else , and that was that the inhabitants werely ate sidewalks right in front of these parts .
so he did what every good developer would do , he wrote an app .
it ' s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you agree to free when it snow .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he named the first al .
if you don ' t do that , somebody can take it away .
so there ' s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a modest little app .
it ' s probably the smallest of the 21 apps the fellows have wrote last year .
but it does something that no other government technology does .
it ' s rapidly spreading out .
there ' s this guy in the i . t . department in the city of hawaii who saw that he could use this app , not for snow , but to make the citizens adopt tsunami sirens .
it ' s very important that these tsunami sirens work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to clean up the clogged dams .
and chicago just introduced it so that people would throw the buzzest when it snow .
we now know nine cities planning to use this app .
and it ' s spread smoothly , organic , of course .
if you know something about government technology , you know that it doesn ' t usually happen that way .
the software usually takes a few years .
we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that three people took two and a half months to .
it was a method where parents could figure out which are the right public schools for their children .
we were later told later that if it went through the normal channels , it would have taken over two years and it would have cost over two million dollars .
and that ' s nothing yet .
there ' s a project right now in the california federal that has cost the taxpayers two billion dollars far , and it doesn ' t work .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so an app that ' s written in a few days , and then spreads by its same is a kind of a shot in front the bug at the institution of government .
it shows how the government could work better - no more like a private company , how many people think it should .
and not just like a tech company , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , that means open and productive .
and that ' s important .
but more important about this app is that it represents a new generation tackling the problem of government - not as the problem of a fake institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out that we ' re very good at collective action with digital technology .
now there ' s a large community of people who are making the tools that we need to effectively put things effectively together .
it ' s not just code for america fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country who standing up and writing government apps in their own communities .
they didn ' t give up the government .
they ' re terribly frustrated with her , but they don ' t complain about it , they repair it .
and these people know something we ' ve lost from our eyes .
and that ' s when you forget all your feelings about politics and the snake at the work office and all the other things that we ' re really excited about is government , at heart , in the words of tim o ' neill , " what we do together , that we can ' t do alone . "
today , a lot of people have gave up the government .
and if you ' re one of these people , i ask you to think about it , because things change .
politics doesn ' t change ; government is in changing .
and because the government ultimately pulls its power out of us - remember , " we the people ? " - how we think about it will affect how this change happens .
i didn ' t know very much about government when i started this program .
and like a lot of people , i thought government was all about getting people in office .
now after two years , i ' ve come to the conclusion that it ' s mostly about communities about thylacilines .
this is the call center for service and information .
that ' s where you typically come out when you call in your city 311 .
if you ever have the chance to work in your urban call center , like our fellow scott silverman as part of the program - in fact , they all do - you ' ll see that people who call government for many lot many different problems , including a thylaci in their house .
so scott gets this addtili .
he puts " thylacine " into the official database .
and he doesn ' t really have an idea . he starts with animal hunter .
and finally , he says , " look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock is dead off out ? "
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that was ' t the end of the thylacines .
boston doesn ' t just have a call center .
it has an app , a web and mobile phone app , called citizens connect .
we didn ' t write this app .
this is the work of very smart people at the office of new urban mechanics in boston .
one day - this is a actual report - this came in : " thylaci in my garbage can . can ' t tell if she ' s dead .
how do i get it away ? "
but what happens to citizens connect is different .
scott was talking human - to - human .
but on citizens connect , everything is public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , a neighbor saw it .
and the next post we got was , " i went over there , found the dumbage can behind the house .
thylaci ? yes . alive ? yap .
turned the garh can on the side . went home .
good night , sweet thylacine . "
pretty simple .
that ' s great . this ' s where the digital hits the physical .
and it ' s also a good example of how the government is to get into crowdsourcing .
but it ' s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don ' t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i ' m talking more about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
one citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role here .
she connected these two people .
and you could have connected them to state services if they had been needed , but a neighbor is a much better and cheaper alternative to government services .
if one neighbor helps other , we strengthen our communities .
if we call the animal owner , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about it that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand this , but they think one is the other ' s .
that our contribution to the system is voting .
how often have we elected a political leader - and sometimes we ' ve used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader - and then we sit back , and we expect the government to reflect our values and fulfill our needs , and then hasn ' t much has changed ?
that ' s because the government is like a bigger ocean , and politics , that ' s the top 15 meterss .
and what ' s below that is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use that word with such contempt .
but it ' s this contempt that this thing that we own , and we pay for , to be something that works against us , something else , and then we get free rid ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that ' s where actual government work happens .
we need to engage with the government machine machines .
so the occupythesec movement did .
did you see these guys ?
it ' s a group of concerned citizens who wrote a very detailed 325 - page report that is an answer to the sec memo on the financial reform .
this is not politically active , this is bureaucratic active .
now , for those of us who have given up government , it ' s time for us to think about it about the world we want to leave to our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to face .
do we really believe that we can do what we need to do without improving an institution that can act in the name of all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to get more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes technology possible to fundamentally refk the function of government in a way that can actually do something by strengthening society .
and there ' s a generation grew up with the internet , and that knows that it ' s not that hard to do things together , all you have to build them systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i ' m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that has grown up to see their voice for granted .
they don ' t fight this fight that we ' re all fighting about who can speak ; they can all talk .
you can make your opinion on every channel at any time , and you do it .
so when you ' re faced with the problem of government problem , you don ' t care so much about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the work of government .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
this could be cleaning a fire hydrant , weeing weed , turning around a trash can with a baglaci .
and i certainly sure we could have erased these fire hydrants all the time , and a lot of people do .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we ' re not just consumers , and we ' re not just government consumers who pay taxes and receiving services .
we ' re more than that ; we ' re are citizens .
and we ' re not going to improve until we improve citizenship .
so the question i have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together all together , are we just going to be a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
really my role is to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming emerging will be , and i thought , since i ' m here among friends , i would tell you what i really think , and also try to look back and understand what ' s really going on here , with these incredible jumps forward that are happen so quickly that we can ' t keep .
i ' m going to start by just showing you a single boring slide .
. could you just show the slide for a .
this is a slide that i happened to choose from my folder .
i ' m not about the details of the slide , but i ' m rather about the overall shape .
this slide shows data from an analysis of us on the performance of risc processors compared to the performance of a local area network .
what ' s interesting here is that this slide , like some other ones that we often find in our field , are kind of right on a semi - logarithmic curve .
in other words , every step here corresponds to a power in the performance scale .
and this is a new thing that we need to use this type of scale on semi - logarithmic curves in the field of technology .
something very strange is happening here .
this is basically what i ' m going to talk about here .
so , if you could turn on the lights back on please .
a little brighter , because i ' m going to draw something on the paper here a minute .
now , why do we draw graphs in technology on semi - logarithmic curves ?
the reason for that is , if i draw it on a normal curve , where , say , these are the years , which so the timeline of a kind , and this is any amount of technology that i want to represent with a graph , the graph will silly .
they are what they look like this .
and that doesn ' t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , let ' s say a transportation technology , on the semi - logarithmic scale , would be very uneaferational , in the form of a flat line .
but if something like this happens , it changes the qualitative conditions .
so if transportation technology was moving on as fast as microprocessor technology , we could get into a taxi morning , and in 30 seconds we were in tokyo .
but it ' s not that fast .
this has never happened before in the history of technology development , this kind of recursive growth , where the scale exponentially every few years .
the question i want to ask you now is , if you look at these exponential curves , you can see , they don ' t go on forever .
it ' s not possible that everything will evolve forever and forever as fast as now .
there are two possibilities .
either it becomes a classic s - curve like this , until something completely new comes in , or it will happen .
that ' s a kind .
now , i ' m an optimist , so i think something that the way that this is .
if that really is it , that means we ' re in the middle of a transition right now .
we ' re on this line , in a transition from the existing world to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask , and i often ask myself , is how is this new world is going to be like ?
what is this new state that the world is starting to adopting ?
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing when you ' re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , the future was somewhere in 2000 , and people were often talking about what was going to happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people are talking about the future , and you reali out that the future is still in the year 2000 .
we don ' t go on that .
so in other words , the future has declined a year every year since i ' ve been in the world .
i think the reason for that is that we realize something is going on .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we know now that it just doesn ' t make any sense just trying to look into 30 or into the future 50 years , because everything will be so different that a simple pyramidutation of what we ' re doing now simply doesn ' t make sense .
so i want to talk about what this might be , this transition that we ' re in right now .
in order to do that , i ' m going to talk first about a of other things that really have nothing to do with technology or computers .
because i think in order to really understand this , we need to step back and look at it on a longer time .
and that is what i want to look at this on the time scale of earth life .
i think the picture makes sense when if you divide it into a billion steps .
so let ' s go back , 2 . 5 billion years . the earth was a big , sterile rocktub with lots of chemicals floating on it .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good picture of how they did this .
i also think there are theories that are beginning to understand how everything all began with rna , but i ' m going to tell you a simplifiedstic story of this , which is that at that time there were little oil droplets of were flrung around , which had different types of recipes for chemicals .
some of these oil droplets had a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and grow .
everyone who were like these started to divide .
these little oil droplets were , in sense , the most primitive cell form .
but these oil droplets weren ' t alive in today sense , because each single one of them was just a small randomal recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided , the chemicals in have dispers distributed in disparal quantities .
so each droplet was a little different .
in fact , the droplets , which had a more optimal composition for growth grew faster than others , and integrated more and more chemicals from the outside and divided faster .
so they tende tend to survive longer , and they multiplied to a greater scale .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but ' gets more interesting when these droplets learned a trick about abstraction .
in some way that we don ' t quite understand , these droplets have learned the ability to write down information down .
they ' ve learned to store the recipe cell as information , in a certain chemical form , which we call dna .
in other words , in this mindless evolutionary way , they found a way to allow them to write down what they were made of , so that this information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information same over the time of 2 . 5 billion years that it was born remained the .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , is out of the exactly the same code and the same type .
and every being uses the exactly the same letters and the same code .
we ' re there that , just for fun , we can write thing in this code .
and i have 100 microgramram of a white powder , which i ' m trying to keep airports away from security guards .
there ' s - what i ' did is i took this code - the code is made up of normal letters that we use to symbolize - and i wrote my business card on a piece of dna and i augmenteed it 10 ^ 22 times .
so if somebody wants a hundred million copies of my business card , i have enough for everyone in this room and even everyone in the world , and it ' s right here .
if i had actually been an selfish , i would have written it on a virus and sent it into the room .
so what ' s the next step ?
writinging down dna was an interesting step .
and that led these cells - that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another very interesting step happened in where things got completely different , which is that these cells started communicaticateing and exchange sharing information so that communities of cells .
i don ' t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually change their dna .
and that ' s why , for example , the persistence grows antibiotics .
some bacteria have figured out how to keep away from penicillin and put that information with other bacteria into the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate with each other .
now this communication allowed the foundations of communities that were , in a sense , were in the same boat ; they were synergeic .
so they either survived together , or they fell down together , which meant that if a community succeeded , all the individuals of the community were repeated and preferred by evolution .
the transition site is now where these communities came together so close that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community into a sign chain on dna .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
at this point , we have multicellular communities , communities of many different cell types that act together as a single organism .
in fact , we ' re also such a multicellular community .
we have a lot of cells that are no longer placed on themselves own .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started began to evolve so that the level in which evolution happened was no longer the single cell , but the whole cell community that we call organism .
now the next step has happen within these communities .
the cell communities began to abstracting information .
and they developed special structures that did do nothing but to process information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the information processing device that these cell communities have built .
they started educating specialists within the community , special structures that were responsible for learning , understanding and capturing information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point , an individual - learning was now happening within the time of the life of a single organism , rather than over that evolutionary time period .
so a organism , could learn not to eat a particular fruit because it tasted bad and made it sick the last time he ate it .
this could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas it was took hundreds of thousands of years that , because this information had to evolutionarily learned by the individuals who died because of this fruit because these information processing structures weren ' t there .
so the nervous system has the evolution process using these special information structures , because evolution could now happen within an individual .
it could happen within a time learning frame learning .
what after that is that individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
for example , the most subticatlet we know version of this communication type is human language .
it ' s a rather amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , messy and confused idea in my head .
i ' m sitting here basically giving making bluing sounds of me , hoping to create a similar confused idea in your head that has a little similar to my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , we turn it into sound , a sequence of sound , and we produce something very complicated in people others ' s heads .
so this allows us to work again as a single organism .
and what we ' ve actually done , we , humanity , is we ' ve started to abstracting .
we go through the same stages that multicellular organisms have gone through - processing the abstraction of our ways of capturing data , processing .
the invention of language , for example , was a small step in that direction .
telecommunications , computers , video tapers , cd - roms and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we ' ve built in our community to handle that information .
and it connects us all together to something that ' s much bigger , and is also able to evolve faster than we ' ve been before .
so today , evolution can happen in the time period of microseconds .
you ' ve also seen ty ' s little example of evolution where he showed a little bit of evolution in the con evolution program , right in front of your eyes .
so now we ' ve re shriled the time scale .
the first steps in the story i told you took a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , took a few hundred million years .
then the next steps , like language and so forth , took less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to take a few decades .
the process feeds on itself , so becomes , i think , car - catalytic is the word for that - when something increases its speed .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that ' s what we see here in this explosion - like curve .
we see the process that feeds itself .
i live professional from building computers , and i know that i couldn ' t use the mechanism i use to build computers without the recent advances in computer technology .
my current work is design objects with such high complexity that it ' s impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
i don ' t know what every single transistor does in the connection machine does .
it has billions of them .
instead , what i do , and what the designers thinking machines are do , is we think at a certain abstract level , give it to the machine , and the machine makes it something that far beyondds our capabilities , better and faster than we could ever do .
and she does it in part with techniques that we haven ' t even understand yet .
one method that ' s particularly interesting , and which i ' ve been used a lot recentlyly , is evolution itself .
and we ' re install an evolutionary process in the machine that ' s going in the microsecond .
to give you an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program developed from random instructions .
we say , " computers , please generate a hundred million randomly selected sequences of instructions .
now , please do all these randomly chosen instructions , do all the programs , and end up choose the ones who are closest to my . "
so in other words , i define what i want first .
let ' s say i want to select numbers , which would be a simple example i ' ve used for .
so find programs that can select the best most to set numbers .
of course , the chance of randomly chosen instructions is very small that they by re just counting numbers , so probably none of the instructions will actually do that .
but one of them may lucky put two numbers in the right order .
now i say , " computers , take the next 10 percent of the sequences that have get closest to my guidelines .
store those , delete the rest .
now reproduce all the remaining ones who have selected the numbers best .
and it with a method of recombinationing , analogous to reproduction . "
take two programs , and they produce kids by sharing their sub - programmertments , and the kids produce the characteristics of the sub - programmers from the two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that come from combinations of programs that come a little closer to the requirements than others .
say , " please repeat this process . "
lua judge them again .
perform some mutations .
and try it again with another generation .
all of these generations need just a few milliseconds .
and so i can run evolution over millions of years in the computer in a few minutes , or in more complicated cases , for a few hours .
finally , i get programs that can rank numbers perfectly .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could have ever written by hand .
so when i look at these programs , i can ' t tell how they work .
i tried to understand them .
they ' re obscure and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know and i ' m sure they ' doing the job , because they come from a series of hundreds of thousands of programs that have done the job .
because their lives depended on whether they did the job right .
i once sat in a 747 with marvin minsky , but he pulls out a card and says , " oh look . look at that .
it says , " this airplane is made up of hundreds of thousands of little bits that work together to make their flight safe . " doesn ' t you make you more contimident ? "
we know that a developmental process isn ' t optimal when it gets too complicated .
so ' re going to rely on computers for a process that ' s very different from classical engineering .
it allows us to produce things with much higher complexity than normal methods would allow us to produce .
and yet we don ' t really understand the possibility of this yet .
so in a way , technology is overhilaking us .
we ' re now using these programs to make the computers much faster , so that we ' re able to do these processes even faster .
so there creates a feedback .
it ' s getting faster and faster , and i think that ' s why it seems so confusing .
because all of these new technologies of today are feeding themselves .
we lift up .
we ' re looking at a point that the analog then when single cell organisms evolved into multicellular organisms .
so we ' re the amoeba , and we can ' t quite figure out what the hell we ' re actually creating here .
we ' re in the middle of this transition point .
but i really believe something coming after us .
i find it very desirable by us to say that we are the end result of evolution .
and i think we all of us here are part of the creation of whatever comes next .
now , lunch is waiting , and i think i ' m going to stop here now before i ' m called nominated out .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the star sky in the desert with sufi singer mukhtiar ali .
we talked about fact that nothing has changed since the time of the ancient indian myth , " mahabharata . "
if we wanted to travel indians back then , we jumped into a car and we swimed across the sky .
now we do it with airplanes .
at the time , when the great indian warrior prince maha had dur , he took a bow , shot into the ground , and water came out .
now we do it with drills and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced with machines .
that made me really sad .
i was a little scared of technology .
it scared me afraid that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset without a camera and without a tweet to my friends .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill magic .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver pocketwatch .
this piece of 50 - year - old technology became the most magical thing for me .
it became a golden access to a world full of pirates and crashed ships and images in my imagination .
and it felt like our fancy watchs and cameras were leaving us from dreaming it .
they kept us from being inspired .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use them to enable magic rather than kill it .
when i was 16 , i started ill books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a storytelling device that can connect readers around the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it brings together images and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
storytelling uses more and more senses .
but what do we do with this ? but
i ' m just go to khoya , an interactive ipad app .
this says , " put your fingers on every light . "
and so - this it says , " this box belongs . " that ' s where i write my name .
and me becomes a figure in the book .
once and a again , a letter falls down to me - and the ipad knows through gps where i live - he ' s really addressd to me .
the child in me is reallycited about possibilities .
i talked a lot about magic .
i don ' t mean about magicians and dragons , but the magic of childhood , the ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass , i always quite exciting .
so you have to flip the ipad and drop the fireflies out .
and they saw up the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can be in a single marble .
and so every book and every world here becomes a little mur that i bring here becomes the magical device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
fantasy books have always had maps , but those maps were static .
this map grows and glows and serves orientation in the rest of the book .
it ' s also shown in other parts of the book .
i ' m going in here .
it ' s also important for me to create something that is s indian , but also very modern .
these are the apsaras .
we ' ve all heard about fairyies and nymphs , but how many people outside of india know their indian colleagues , the apsaras ?
the poor apsaras had been caught in indra ' s chambers for thousands years in an old gommy book .
and we bring them back in a contemporary story for children .
it ' s a story that deals with new issues , like the environmental crisis .
the environmental crisis , a big problem over the last 10 years is that kids are sitting in their rooms at their computers without going out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book , you ' re sent to a search ; you have to go out and collect ipad images of natural objects with your camera .
as a child , i had collections of sticks , rocks , pebbles and seashells .
somehow kids don ' t do anymore .
this childhood ritual is brought back . you have to go out to take a picture and tag mark a chapter .
in another chapter , you have to photographe a and tag a piece leaves .
so you actually create a digital collection of photos that you can then put online .
a kid in london shows a picture of a fox and says , " oh , i ' ve saw a fox today . "
a kid in india says , " i saw a monkey today . "
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that they actually took .
there are a variety of ways of connecting magic connecting the world and technology together .
in the next book , we ' re planning to an interaction where you use the video of the ipad , and through augmented reality , you see an animation of 11 appearing on a plant in front of the house .
at one point , the screen fills with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the wind , blow it away and read the rest of the book .
we ' re all moving towards a world where the natural forces of technology come closer , and where magic and technology can con connectfronta .
we use the of the sun .
we bring our children and our closer to the natural world and the magic , fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in prisons , prisons or deathmates .
i spend most of my time in the most socially weakest in the social and places where there ' s a lot of hopelessness .
being here at ted , seeing and hearing how stimulating that is has given me a lot of strength .
in the short time , i realized one : ted has an identity .
you can say here things here that have a global impact .
and sometimes when something comes about ted , it gets a meaning and a force that it wouldn not have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we ' ve seen some fantastic presentations .
i think we ' ve learned that the words of a teacher have meaning , but that the words of an engaged teacher are particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . but as a careing doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn ' t learn that in my work as a lawyer , by the way .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i grew up in a family , a traditional african - american household , dominated by a matriarch , and that matriarch was my grandmother .
she was a tough , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every family feud .
it was also the beginning of a lot of conflicts in our family .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
their parents were born in virginia in the 1840s as slaves .
she was born around 1880 , and the experience of slavery really shaped herview .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a little boy , she came up to me and hugged me .
she squed me so hard that i could barely breathe , and then she let me go .
a hour or two later , when i met her , she came up to me and said , " bryan , do you still feel my hug ? "
and when i said , " no , " she hud me again . when i said , " yes , " she left me alone .
she was something to her that made that you always wanted to be close to her .
the only problem with this was that she had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get her attention .
my cousins were walking around all the place .
i remember , i must have been eight or nine , that i woke up one morning and went to the living room , all my cousins were walking around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the room staring at me .
first of all , i thought this was a game .
i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very serious .
this went on for 15 or 20 minutes . then she stood up and she came over to me , and she grab took me by the hand , and she said , " come , bryan . you and me , we have to talk . "
i remember when it was yesterday .
i ' ll never forget it .
she took me outside and said , " bryan , i ' m going to tell you something , but you have to promise you don ' t keep it on . "
i said , " promise , grandmy . "
she said , " honor name ? " i said , " yes . "
she sat down and she looked at me . she said , " i want you to know that i watched you . "
she said , " i think you ' re special . "
she said , " i think you can do anything you want to do . "
i ' ll never forget that .
then she said , " you just have to promise me three things , bryan . "
i said , " ok , grandma . "
she said , " first of all , she promise me that you will always love your mom . "
she said , " your mom is my baby , and you have to promise with promise that you will always take care of her . "
i adored my mother , so i said , " yes , mommy , i ' m going to do that . "
then she said , " next thing she promised me that you will always do the right thing , " even if it ' s hard to do the right thing . "
i thought it , and i said , " yes , grandmy . i promise it . "
finally , she said , " the last thing you have to promise me is " you ' re never going to drink alcohol . "
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , " yes , grandmy . i promise . "
i grew up in the country , in the old rural south , and i have a brother who ' s a year older and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this six packk of beer and grabbed my sister and i and went into the forest .
we ' re just around as we anyone else .
then he took a drink of beer and he offered my sister one , and she accepted , and then they offered me one .
i said , " no , no , no . ok . just do that . i don ' t want beer . "
my brother said , " well , do go . today we ' re doing this today , you do everything else we do .
i had something , your sister had something . go on , drink a beer . "
i said , " i don ' t want . just do . just do . "
my brother was staring at me .
he said , " what ' s going on about you ? well , drink something . "
then he looked in my face , and he said , " oh no , you don ' t you still always still crazy about talking with grandma ? "
i said , " what are you talking about ? "
he said , " grandma tells all grandchildren they ' re special . "
i was devastated .
i ' m going to ask you something .
i probably shouldn ' t do that .
this may be reported public .
i ' m 52 years old , and i admit that i ' ve never drunk a drop of alcohol .
i ' m not saying that because i think it ' s virtuous . i m say that because identity means power .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell the people around us things they don ' t believe at first .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn ' t do .
of course , my grandmother would tell all their grandchildren they ' re special .
my grandfather was in jail during the siege .
my uncles died of alcoholic diseases .
and she believed that these were the topics that we had to care of .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300 , 000 people were in prison institutions and in prison .
today it ' s 2 . 3 million .
the united states has the ' s highest incarceration rate in the world today .
seven million people are discharged to rehabilitation or with conditional punishment .
in my view , mass arrests fundamentally changed our world .
in socially weak and black parts of the population , have despair and hopelessness because of these changes .
one of three male black men between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , sentenced released to rehabilitation or conditional punishment .
in urban communities all over the country - from los angeles to philadelphia , baltimore to washington - 50 to 60 percent of all black young men are either in prison , in prison , released to rehabilitation or conditional punishment .
but our system is not only shaped by questions that have to do with race , but it ' s also depleted by poverty .
we have a justice system in this country that treat them much better if they ' re rich and guilty than poor and innocent .
wealth , not debt , affects the outcome .
yet we seem to be very happy with it .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we lost contact .
i find that ' s interesting .
there are some very interesting developments .
my home state of alabamas them the right to if they ' re prose convicted .
here and in alabama today , 34 percent of the black population have permanently lost their vote .
we predict that 10 years , the rate of denfirmation of civil honor rights will be as high as before the voting bill passed .
silence is earing .
i trust children .
a lot of my clients are very young .
the united states is the only country in the world that sentences three - year - old children to death in prison .
in this our country , there are lifelong sentence for children without conditional punishment .
we ' ve run a lot of techniques .
the only country in the world .
i represent people in death row .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we believe that because we ' ve been taught in that the real question is : does a man deserves to die for a crime committed by him ?
that ' s a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about it based on how we see our identity .
the other view is not : did someone deserve death for a crime , but , do we deserve to kill ?
i find that ' s fascinating .
death penalty in america is defined by error .
on nine people we executed , one that we found as innocent , who was rescued and released out from of the death row .
an amazing error rate . one out in nine is innocent .
i find that ' s fascinating .
we would never let anybody fly in on an airplane if for nine planes that fly off , one crash .
but somehow we manage to get away from this problem .
it ' s not our problem .
it ' s not our burden .
it ' s not our fight .
i talk a lot about these questions .
i ' m talking about race and the question of whether we have the right to kill .
and it ' s exciting because i teach my students african - american history . i talk about slavery .
i ' m talking about terrorism , the time before the end of reconstruction , way until the beginning of world war ii .
we don ' t really know a much about it .
but for the african - american people in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of terrorism .
or from bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her lives .
now these older people are coming to me and say , " mr . , . stevenson , they talk , they ' re giving talks . they tell people to stop saying that we have had for the first time in the history of our nation , after 9 / 11 . "
they say , " no - tell people that we grew up with this . "
and after terrorism , of course , race and decades of racly - driven discrimination and apartheid .
and yet , there ' s a dynamic in our country - we don ' t like to talk about our problems .
we don ' t like to talk about our story .
and so we don ' t really understand what meaning our actions have in the historical context .
we ' re always hitting each other .
we always create new tensions and new conflicts .
it ' s hard for us to talk about race , and i think that ' s because we ' re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people have understood that race is not overcome without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there was this willingness , but not in this country .
i ' ve given some talks in germany about death penalty .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , " you know , it ' s deeply disturbing to hear them say talk that way . "
he said , " there is no death penalty in germany .
and of course , in germany , they can never be existmore . "
it got all silenced . then a woman said , " with our story , it ' s impossible that we will ever speaked for systematically killing people .
it would be unless by us to be consciously and specificallyly target people . "
i thought about it .
what it would feel like to live in a world where the german state forced people , especially if there were uni many jews .
it would be uncomfortable .
it would be conscienceless .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old south , we ' shooting people - here ' s the risk of being sentenced to death , 11 times higher when the victim is white than if it ' s black , 22 times higher when the trial is black and the victim is white - in the same states where the bodies of unsrant people . and .
and yet there ' s this mental disconnect .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don ' t deal with these difficult topics , then the positive and wonderful things are affected as .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but ultimately , these realities are overloo by suffering , abuse , transation , discrimination .
it seems me to me to unite both .
because we ' re up talking about how we need more hope , more engagement , more dedication , to existist in a complex world .
for me , that means takes time to think and talk about the poor disadvantaged , the ones who will never be at ted .
but think in a way that ' s embedded in our own lives .
we all need to end up believe things that we can ' t see .
we do . as rational as we are , as much as we value intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development isn ' not just come from our heads .
they come from ideas driven by the belief in our hearts .
it ' s this head - heart connection , which i think believe think drives us to be not just be open to all the bright and exciting things , but also to the dark and problematic things .
vaclav , the great zimbabwe politician , once said .
" when we fought eastern europe against oppression , we wanted everything things , but what we needed most was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to be in hopeless places sometimes and to be witnessing . "
this mental orientation is the core of what i believe that the ted communities also need to be engaged in .
there ' s no distinction between technology and design that allows us to be fully human , as unless as we don ' t also have eyes and ears for poverty , discrimination and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity favors a lot more of us than if we didn ' t care about it .
she will to deeply touch her .
as a young lawyer , i have the great privilege of meeting rosa parks .
mrs . parks kept coming back to montgomery , where she met two of her oldest friends , these older women , johnnie carr , who had organized the montgomery bus - an incredible african - american woman - and virginia durr , a white one whose husband , clifford durr , represented dr . king .
so these women met and they just talked .
sometimes ms . carr called me and she said , " bryan , ms . parks is coming to the city . we want to talk to each other .
do you want to come and listen ? "
and i said , " yes , very much . "
she said , " and what are you going to do when you ' re here ? "
i said , " i ' m going ll listen . "
and i went over and i just listened .
it was always so inspiring , so exciteing .
one day , i was sitting there listening to these women , and after a few hours , ms parks turned to me around us , " well bryan , tell me what the right initiative is .
what are they trying to do ? "
i started with my usual talk .
i said , " we ' re trying to fight injustice .
we want to help people who were convicted innocently .
we want to fight biasce and discrimination in the criminal justice system .
we want to eliminate lifelong sentences without conditional punishment for children .
we want to do something about death penalty .
we want to reduce the number of prisoners .
we want to eliminate mass inrceration . "
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , " oomm . humm . humm . "
she said , " that ' s ll make her you very , very tired . "
then ms . carr leaned to me , and put a finger on my face , and said , " and that ' why you have must to be very , very brave . "
and so i believe that the ted community should be more braver .
we have to find ways . to face these challenges : these problems , these suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our all humanity .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i learned a few very simple things .
that we ' re all more than the worst thing we ' ve ever done .
i think that ' s true of every human being on the planet .
when someone lies , it ' s not just a liar .
if somebody takes something they doesn ' t belong , it ' s not just a thief .
even who kills someone is not just a murderer .
and because that is s the case , there ' s a fundamental human dignity that has respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the world , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don ' t think so .
i believe that in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i believe that even though it ' s so dramatic , so beautiful and so inspiring , and so expiring , we ' re not being measured by our technology , not by the things that we ' re develop , not by our intellect and minds .
finally , a society is not measured by how they treats its rich and powerful and privileged , but by how it deals with the poor , the convicted , the prisoners .
because in this context , we begin to understand the truly amazing things that make us up .
sometimes i lose balance . a story to the end .
sometimes i pushge too much .
i m get tired , like all of us .
sometimes these ideas impipive to our thinking in a very important ways .
i represent these kids who were sentenced to very hard punishments .
i go to the prison and i visit a client who ' may to be 13 or 14 years old , who ' s supposed to be in trial as adult .
then i wonder , how could that happen ?
how can a judge turn someone into something he ' s not ?
the judge looks at him as an adult , but i see a child .
one night , i stayed up too long and thought , my god , if a judge can transform us into something else , he must to have magic powers .
right , bryan , the judge has magic .
you should also wish them .
and because it was late , and i couldn ' t think right anymore , i started working on an proposal .
i had a 14 - year - old poor black boy as clients .
and i started with this proposal . the headline was , " request to treat my poor 14 - year - old black client like a privileged , white , 75 - year - old top manager . "
in my appeal , i explained that misduct taken by prosecutor and police and court failures .
there was a crazy line about the fact that there ' s nothing more right in this country , that there ' s only misconception .
the next morning , i woke up and i didn ' t know whether i had just dreamed of this crazy proposition or actually wrote it .
and to my dismay , i had only not write him , but i also sent him to the court .
a few months went by , and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i ' ve got to go to the court and this crazy case .
i got in the car , and i was really overwhelmed - overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought , this is going to be so hard , so painful .
finally , i got out of my car and i went up the stairs to the court .
when i went up the stairs to the court , there was an older black man , the janitor in the .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , " who are you ? "
i said , " i ' m a lawyer . " he said , " you ' re a lawyer ? " i said , " yes . "
he came up to me and hugged me .
then he whispered me into my ear .
he said , " i ' m so proud of you . "
and i have to say , it gave me power .
it touched something very deeply about me , identity , the ability of each individual to contribute to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i walked into the courtroom .
as soon as the judge saw me .
he said , " mr . stevenson , did you propose this crazy proposal ? "
i said , " yes . " and then we started discussuing .
more and more people coming in just because they were angry .
that i had written these crazy things .
police officers came in and prosecutors and office officers .
turn around the courtroom was full of people who were angry that we were talking about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
from my eye of my eye , i saw the janitor go up and down .
he kept looking through the window again , he could hear the whole tohuwabohu .
he went up and down .
finally , this older black man with me with a very concerned look came into the courtroom and sat right behind me , almost on the defense bank .
ten minutes later , the judge pause .
during the break , a police officer came in , who he disturbed that the janitors was in the courtroom .
this deputy ran over to the older black .
he said , " jimmy , what do you do in the courtroom ? "
the older black man stood up . he looked at the deputy , then he looked at me , and he said , " i came here to tell this young man , don ' t lose the target eyes . don ' t give up . "
i came to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral penmutle of the universe is far sw , but it app appeals to justice .
that we are re not fully evolved as humans , unless as we don ' deal about human rights and basic values .
that our survival are connected to each individual ' survival .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity with humanity , compassion and justice .
and most of all , i just want to say to those of you who see this : don ' t lose the goal out from your eyes . don ' t give up .
you ' ve seen and heard this audience this a obvious wish to help them and do something .
what else can we do ?
bryan stevenson : well , there are possi everywhere .
if you live in california , s there ' s a people ' decision in this spring ' s about actually doing a effort to shift some of the amount of money that would otherwise goes into the politics of punishment .
here , in california , for example , in the next five years you ' ll spend a billion dollars on death penalty - a billion dollars .
and yet 46 percent of all killing cases don ' t end with arrest .
56 percent of all rape cases do not come to the court .
here ' s a chance to do something .
this reference will suggest to invest the money in more security forces and more security .
i think there are possi everywhere .
over the last three decades , the crime rate in america has dramaticarmously declined .
this fact is often put in with increased incarceration rates .
what would you say someone who believes that ?
well , in fact , the number of violence crimes has not changed very much .
most of the mass arrests in this country didn not ' t really occur in the class of violence crimes .
it was the misguided battle against drugs .
that ' s why the dramatic high numbers come to in prison .
we goted away from the rhetoric of punishment .
now we have three - violationtion " laws that forever put people behind jail , for a bicycle robbing , for theft of partial good , rather than forcing them to give back things back to the victims .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of a crime , not less .
and i believe that our current punishment philosophy doesn ' t help anybody .
i think that ' s what we need to change .
bryan , they really made a string vibrate here .
they ' re an inspiring personality .
thank you for being at ted . thank you .
bin laden ' s death has an increased risk of danger .
2 : famine in somalia . three : police o carming from the .
4 : maliious cartels . 5 : dangerous cruise ships .
six : social decline . 7 : 65 deaths .
8 : tsunami warning . 9 : cyber attacks .
different voices : drug war . weapons of mass destruction . tornado .
recession . grid . doom dyay . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a few of the clips that i ' ve collected over the last six months - but it could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
in fact , the media preferfers to show us negative topics , because our minds pay attention to those topics .
and there ' s a very good reason for that too .
every second every day , our senses discover a lot more information than our brain can ever process .
and because we do nothing more than our survival , the first link for all this information is part of our temporal lobe , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early warning system , our dangerous sensor .
it organize databases and looks through all the information looking for any suggest of danger in our environment .
so when we see the news , we prefer to looking for negative news .
and the old adage , " if it s rain , demand up " is very true .
now , with all our digital devices that give us seven days a week , 24 hours all these negative news a day , it ' s no wonder that we ' re pessimistic .
it ' s no wonder that everybody thinks the world is getting worse and worse .
but maybe that ' s not the case .
maybe that ' s reality .
maybe the enormous progress that we ' ve made in the last century by a series of forces is accelerating so strong that in the next three decades we be able to create a world of abundance .
now , i ' m not saying we don ' t have big problems - climate crisis , biodiversity loss , water and energy issues - we already have them .
and as humans , we ' re much better at anticipating problems in a very long run , but ultimately overcome them .
let ' s look at what we ' ve achieved in the last century , so we can predict evolution .
in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled , the average income in the world ' s population has tripled .
child mortality has reduced by a tenth .
and also thing is that diet , electricity , transportation and communication costs have dropped by a substantial times .
steve pinker shown us that we live in a very peaceful period of human history .
and according to charles kenny , literacy rate has gone from 25 percent to 80 percent years .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we keep increasing our expectations .
in fact , we ve redefined poverty .
remember that a large percentage of americans who live below the poverty line have access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , televisions , cell phones , air conditioners and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the earth imperators of earth , could never have dreamed of such luxury goods .
the basis of a lot of this is technologies , and they are re growing exponentiallyly .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that becomes information technology makes big curves on the curve of moore ' s law , and the price performance quotient doubling every 12 to 24 months .
so the cell phone in your pocket costs about a million times less , and is a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the ' 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore ' s law of the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
the first is , how smooth it goes - in good times ones as in bad times , war or peace , recession , depression and high depression .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
it doesn ' t slows down for any of our big problems .
and , despite its logarithmic path on the left , it goes upward .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore ' s law , we find a number of extraordinary technologies that are available to all .
cloud computing , what my friends at autodesk call infinite computing , sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers that enable to democratize personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , fuels , vaccines and food , digital medicine , nanotuble materials and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm ' s supercomputer watson at risk ?
that was great .
i went through the newspapers and looked for the best headlines i could find .
i love this one : " watson defeat defeated human enemies . "
" risk " is not a simple game .
it ' s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence was available to every owner of a cell phone .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i started a new university at ted called singularity university .
we teach our students all of these technologies with a special focusing on how they can be used to solve humanity ' s big challenges .
and every year , we ask the students to create companies , products and services that within a decade can positive affect the lives of billions of people .
think how that a group of students can affect the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this had sound ridiculous .
today we can refer to dozens of companies that have done that .
when i think about creating abundance , i don ' t mean a life of luxury for everyone on the planet ; i ' m about creating a life of possibilities .
it ' s about creating abu out of scar resources goods .
scarcity is contextual , and technology is a resource - liberating force .
here ' s an example .
this is the story of napoleon iii , in the middle - the 18th century .
he ' s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of siam for dinner .
napoleon ' s soldiers got silver brdes , napoleon himself got gold bribedes .
but the king of siam got aluminum bres .
alnum was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and platinum .
this is why the dome of the washington monument is made aluminum .
althoughuminum takes 8 . 3 percent of the earth ' s mass , it doesn ' t seem like pure metal .
it ' s connected by oxygen and siliconette .
but then the technology of electrotisy was developed and made aluminum production so cheap that we use it with our throwaway mentality .
then let ' s project this analogy into the future .
we think today about energy scarcity .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that ' filled with 5 , 000 times more energy than we use every year .
16 terawatts of energy bounce to the earth every 88 minutes .
it ' s not scarcity ; the problem is access .
and there ' s good news .
this year , the first managed to reduce the cost of solar electricity in india to 50 percent of the diesel electricity - 8 . 8 rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year .
last month , it published in a study that shows that up by the end of this decade in the sunny areas of the united states , solar will cost six cents a kwh as compared to 15 cents at the national average .
and if we have an amount energy , we will have water abundantndance .
let ' s talk about water wars .
do you remember when carl sagan turned the voyager spacecraft in 1990 , when it passed by saturn , back towards earth ?
he took a famous picture . what did it mean ?
" a pale blue dot . "
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet that ' s 70 percent covered in water .
yes , there ' s 97 . 5 percent saltwater , two percent is frozen , and we ' re fighting for 0 . 5 percent of the water on the planet , but there ' s also hope here .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it ' s new nanotechnology on the way , nano materials .
and from a conversation this morning with dean kaman , one of the innovators of do it yourself , i want to share something with you - he gave me permission - his technology called slingshot , " which many of you may have heard about . it ' s the size of a refrigerator in the college .
it can produce a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day from different sources - whether saltwater , polluted water , latrine - and all of that for less than two cents an .
the head of coca - cola has just agreed to start a big test project with a hundred units in the developing world .
and if everything goes well , and i ' m very confident , coca - cola will applying this technology globally in 206 countries around the planet .
this is technology - enabled innovation that ' s available today .
and we ' ve also seen this in mobile phones as well .
oh my goodness , we ' re about to reaching reach the 70 percent coverage rate of mobile phones in the developing world by the end of 2013 .
just remember that a masai warrior with a cell phone in the middle of kenya has a better mobile communication than president reagan 25 years ago .
and if you look with your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information than president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in abundance as no one could ever predicted .
and it ' s even better , the things that you and i have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on - gps , hd video and photography , libraries full of books and music , medical diagnosis technology - are now literally decoorized and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best part this is what ' s expecting us in health .
last month , i had the pleasure of announceing the amd foundation what we called the $ 10 million amd tricot x prize .
we challenge teams around the world to connect all of these technologies together in a mobile phone so that you can talk to the device because it ' s equipped with ai , you can shoot in or test your blood levels .
and in to win , the device has to dia a better diagnosis than a team of highly qualified doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease burden and 1 . 3 percent of the public health care workers employees .
if this device sequences a rna virus or dna virus that ' s not known , it calls the health agency and prevents a pandemic from the outbreak .
but now , the greatest force that ' s going to lead us to a world of abundance .
i call it " the next billion . "
the white lines represent population .
we ' ve just crossed the seven billion brand .
and just by the way , the biggest protection against a population explosion is a better education and nutrition around the world .
in 2010 , we had connected together under two billion people online .
by 2020 , we ' re probably going from two billion to five billion internet users .
three billion new minds we ' ve never heard of about before will join global communication .
what do these people need ?
what will they consume ? what will you desire ?
and instead of economic stagnation , i see one of the greatest economic things in history .
these people represent several trillion dollars flow into the global economy .
and they ' re going to healthier by using the tricoder , and they ' re getting better trained by the khan academy , and by they ' re going to have the ability to use 3d printers and infinite computing , and be so much more productive than they ' ever before .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the human community bring us ?
how about a set of new voices never heard voices before ?
how about giving the oppressed , wherever they are , a voice to understand and create change for the first time ?
what will these three billion people bring ?
how about contributions we can ' t even predict ?
one of the things that i ' ve learned through the x prize is that small teams are motiv driven by passion and focus can create extraordinary things , things that big companies and governments could only create in the past .
i want to end with a story that really excited me .
there ' s a program that some people may know about .
it ' s a game called foldit .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it ' s a game in which people can take a sequence of amino acids to study how the protein is going to evolve .
depending on its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in medical research .
so far , this has been a problem for supercomputers .
and this game was played by university professors and so on .
and there ' s now hundreds of thousands of people who have played the game online .
and it showed that today , human pattern recognition today better folds the proteins than the best supercomputers .
and when these people came and looked saw who ' the ' s best protein folder in , this wasn ' t a mit professor , it wasn ' t a caltech student , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was worked as a assistant ofwoman at a rehab clinic during the and was the best protein folder in the world at night .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me tremenouss confidence in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals to confront the big challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a diy innovator .
we have the capital of techno - philanthropists .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work with online to solve with the new challenges and to do what it ' s needed .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i believe that we have to do something against a changing piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a doctor , and he ' s me .
and maybe i ' ve been in the business for a long enough that i can allow myself to give up a piece of my own wrong prestige to do that .
but before i get to the actual theme of my talk , let ' s start with a little bit of baseball .
hey , why not ?
we ' re close to the season , and we ' re moving towards the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
moneyball will to soon appear and it ' s about statistics , and to use them , to build a great baseball team .
i ' m going to re refer to a statistic that i hope that most of you have heard about before .
it ' s the average performance of the bat .
we ' re talking about a 300 when a bat beats 300 .
that means the player surely beats three of 10 beats .
that is hitting the ball in the outside field , it comes out , it ' s not caught , and if you tried the ball to throw to the first base , you didn ' t make it in time , and the runner was safe .
three of 10 .
do you know what you call a 300 in major league baseball ?
well , really good , maybe an all - star .
do you know what it call a 400th ?
this is somebody who ' s actually probably hitting four out of 10 .
legendary - , - like ted williams legendary - the last major league baseball player who hit over 400 times during a regular season .
let ' s move back to my world of medicine , where i feel much more comfortable , or maybe a little less comfortable after i talked to you about it .
suppose you ' ve have had a blind disease , and you ' re sent to a surgeon whose average performance is 400 in terms of blind disorders .
somehow it doesn ' t work , right ?
suppose you live in a particular remote area , and you have a beloved person with clogged heart valve , and your home doctor gives him to a cardiologist whose average performance of vascular reconstruction is 200 .
but , but you know what ?
it ' s much better this year . it ' s on the rise branch .
and she beating a 257 .
somehow it doesn ' t work .
but i ' m going to ask you a question .
what do you think the average performance for a cardiologist or a nurse or an orthopedic , a birth defect , a nurse worker should be ?
1 , 000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody in all of medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor or a rescue officer should be .
however , what we do is we send each of you , including me , into the world with the desire claim to be perfect .
never make a mistake , but nobody thinks about the details of how this is to be done .
and this is the message i recorded in medical school .
i was a compsesly obsessionsive student .
in high school , a collemate once said that brian goldmann would to learn for a blood test .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little rooftop at the nurse sisters ' s home at toronto general hospital , just from here .
i memorized everything .
in my anatomy lecture , i learned the origins and branches of every muscle , every branch of every artery that takes away from the aorta , obscure and ordinary differential diagnostics .
i even knew the differential diagnosis to classify renal tubulary aminois .
and all the time , i collecting more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i graduated with degree .
and i left medical school with the impression that , if i knew everything memorized and knew everything , or at least as much as possible , was as close to complete as possible , that i was immune to making mistakes .
and it worked for a while , until i met mrs printers .
i served at a teaching hospital here in toronto when a woman printer was brought to the emergency department of the hospital .
at that point , i was given to the cardiology group in cardiology service .
and it was my assignment when the emergency staff was looking for cardiology advice to study the emergency patient .
and give feedback to my chief doctor .
i studied ms . printer , and she was in breath .
and as i listened to her , she made bu noises .
and when i holding her chest with the stethoscope , i could hear a crushing sound on both sides that told me that she was suffering from recu heart failure .
this is a state where the heart fails , instead of pumping the entire blood , a part of the blood lies stuck in the lung and begins fills it , which is why short breath came .
and that wasn ' t a hard - to - pose diagnosis .
i sat her down and i went to treatment .
i gave her aminomon . i gave her medicine to take the pressure off the heart .
i gave her medicine what we call diuretics , water pills , so that she cut off the liquid .
and over a an hour and a half to two half hours , she began to feel better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my chief doctor .
i didn ' t take the phone and did what i should have had , what a phone call would have been to my chief to explain it to him , so that he had an a chance to take a his own picture .
and he knew her that he had been able to contribute extra information to her .
maybe i did it for good reason .
maybe i didn ' t want to be the needy doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i was acted that way , and so i would be able to take care of my patients without having to contact him .
my second mistake was worse .
so by sending her home , i ignored a quiet voice in me trying to tell me , " goldman , not a good idea . don ' t . "
in fact , i was so much lack of self - confidencecy that i asked the nurse who took care of mrs . printer , " do you think it ' s okay when she goes home ? "
and the nurse thought about it and said , in a fact way , " yeah , i think she ' s going to be okay . "
i remember it as it was yesterday .
so i signed the discharge papers , and a ambulance and the rescuemen came and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , the night , i had this grim feeling in my stomach .
but i kept working .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , i left the hospital , and i went to the parking lot to drive home with the car when i was doing something i didn ' t do .
i went through the emergency department on my way home .
and there was another nurse , not the sister who had seen after her printer , but another three words to me , and those three words fear most emergency doctors i know .
other doctors also fear these as well , but emergency medicine is particularly because we see patients as volle .
the three words are : remember that ?
" do you remember the patient you sent home ? "
asked the nurse asked care .
" so , she ' s back , " she said in this particular tone .
so she was back . so
she was back and dying .
about an hour after she got at home after i sent her home , she collapsed , and the family called 971 , and the rescue workers took her back to the emergency room with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous shock state .
she barely breath and was turned blue .
the emergency crew pull pulled all the strands .
they gave their blood pressureer .
they attached them to the anesting machine .
i was shocked and i punched into inside .
and i went through this rollercoaster because she came to intensive care after stabilization , and i hoped that she would recover .
and after two , three days , it realized clear that she was never going to come up again .
she had suffered a non - treatable brain damage .
her their family gathered .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they recovered to what happened .
the next day they had them go - ms . printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
they ' re said that you never forget the names of those who die .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
the next few weeks , i , and i learned for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture - i felt alone , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame you feel because you can ' t talk to the colleagues about it .
you all know the healthy shame , when you give a secret to the best friend prize , even though they he threatnds you into corruption and then you get caught and the best friendfronts you with it and have a terrible conversation , but when you end up have bad and you swear you never make such a mistake again .
if you do re and you never make the mistake again .
that ' s the kind of educationalnal shame .
the unhealthy way i ' m talking about is the one that makes you sick inside .
it ' s the one who tells you that it ' not what you ' ve done is bad , ' s you ' re bad yourself .
and that ' s what i felt .
and it wasn ' t because of my senior doctor ; he was very nice .
he was talking to the family , and i ' m sure he broke the woges and made sure that i wasn ' t get sued .
but i began to asked myself these questions .
why didn ' t i ask the chief doctor ? why did i send her home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
why did i go to medicine ?
slowly but surely it was .
i started to feeling better .
and then on a cloudy day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke out , and i said , maybe i can feel better again .
and i went to myself that if i doubled my efforts for perfection and never made a mistake again , the voice could mutt .
and she did .
and i kept working .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had emergency ward in a community hospital north of toronto , and i looked at a 25 - year - old man with azrationtive revenge .
there was a lot of work on and i was a rushing .
he always pointed here .
i looked in the th , and it was a little bit pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and i sent him on away .
and even when he walked out of the door , he pointed out to his revenge .
two days later , i came to my next emergency service , and my chief doctor asked me to have a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
" do you remember the patient with the irrationted revenge ? "
it turns out he ' s a streptococol infection .
he had a potentially - threat disease called epis .
you can google this , but it ' s not an infection of revenge , it ' s of the upper breath and causes the mouth of the breathory system .
and fortunately , he didn ' t die .
he got intraveny antibotica and recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same soup of shame and self - doubt , felt liberated and went back to work until it happened again and again and again .
in an emergency zone , i missed a blindfold disorder times .
there ' s a lot of this involved , especially you consider that you ' working in a hospital that only had 14 patients a night at that time .
in both cases , i didn ' t send them home , and there was probably no shortage in her treatment as either well .
one of i thought he had kidney stones .
i arranged the x - rays ray of the kidneys , and when that was without finding , my colleague found re a station in the lower right sectorion and called the surgeons .
the other one had a severe diarrhea .
i added fluids to rehydrate it , and i asked my colleagues to as well .
and that ' s what he did , and when he saw a staling in the right - sector , he called the surgeons .
in both cases , they were surgery , and they were doing fine .
both cases were scratching me , asked me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake only happened in the first five years , which many lot of my colleagues say , but is totally nonsense .
some of my crackamps have happened in over the last five years .
alone , embarrassed and without support .
here ' s the problem : if i can ' t end with my mistakes and talk about them , if i can t find the quiet voice that tells me what really happened , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes so that they don ' t do the same thing ?
if i went into a room - like right now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when ' s the last time you ve heard about someone talking about failure over failure over failure ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party , and you may hear about any other doctor , but you ' re not t going to hear somebody talk about your their mistakes .
if i went to a room full of colleagues and asked for their immediate support and started telling them what i just told you , i probably would ' t reach the end of the second story before you really embarrasable , somebody would make a joke , they would change the topic and forget the rest . and . asked . i for . if . if .
and in fact , if i or my colleagues knew that an orthopedic in my hospital had taken someone ' s wrong leg , believe me , i had trouble looking him in the eyes .
this is the system that we live in .
it ' s a complete denial of mistake .
it ' s a system in which there are two basic positions - those who make mistakes and those who don ' t do , those who constrate sleep deprivation and those without constration , those with bad results and those with good results .
it ' s almost an ideological reaction , just like antibodies that attack a human .
and there ' s this idea that if we remove those who make mistakes from medicine , we remain a safe system .
but there are two problems with this .
in my about 20 years of medical show and journalism , i did a personal medical study of medical errors and false treatment to learn everything i could learn for one of my first articles i wrote for the toronto star to my show , " white coat , black art . "
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely inevitable .
we work in a system where mistakes happen happens every day , where one out of 10 drugs is either a wrong or a wrong , where hospital infections become more and more and more and cause devastation or dead .
in this state , about 24 , 000 canadians die of verbal errors .
in the united states , the institute of medicine estimates the number at 100 , 000 .
both of these are strong understatements , because we don ' t look at the problem as much as we should .
and it ' s the crux .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge double doubles every two to three years , we can ' t compete .
sleep deprivation is ubiquitous .
we can ' t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive mistake , so that we can take a perfect path for a patient with chest pain .
then i take the same patient with chest pain , i make him sweaty and swy , and i give a slightly alcoholized breath on it , and all of a sudden the story is filled with contempt .
i ' m not take the same course .
i ' m not a robot ; i don ' t always do the same .
and my patients are ' t cars ; they don ' t tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all of this put in together is mistakes are inevitable .
so if you take the system in the way that i ' ve been taught , and you wi out all the errored health experts , there one is left at .
and do you know the truth about people who don ' t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , " white coat , black art , " i have the habit of saying , " this is my worst mistake " i would say to anyone from the rescue engineer to the head of cardiologists , " this is my worst mistake " blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , " what about your ? " and then i show him with the microphone .
and then their eyeball expand , they ' ve pushed in front of the head , then they look down and theyallop hard , and they start telling their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , " look , don ' t make the same mistakes i made . "
what they need is an environment that enable makes them to do it .
what they need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the newly defined doctor is a man who , knows about his humanity , accepts it , is not proud of making mistakes , but has all learning from them so that it can be passed on .
she sharess her experiences with others .
it supports when others talk about their mistakes .
and it shows others their mistakes , not just to justify , but in a loving , supportive way so that everyone benefits from it .
and she ' s working in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and if that ' s the case , people also make mistakes from time to time .
so that the system is develop to make backups that make it easier to find mistakes that people inevitably make , and also allows create loving , supportive spaces where anyone who ' s watches health can actually address things that make potential mistakes and even rewarded for them , and specifically for people like me who make mistakes and be rewarded for the giving of them .
my name is brian goldman .
i ' m the newly doctor .
i ' m a human . i make mistakes .
i regret . but i ' m trying to able to learn it to pass it to others .
i don ' t know what you think of me , but i can live with that .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i ' m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it ' s about changeing norm values .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i ' m going to tell you three stories before to use the time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know that he was here in 1835 .
you may think that he was cha hunting fins , but that ' s not true .
he actually collected fish .
he described one of them as very " ordinary . "
it was a grouper .
until the ' 80 , it was fished in a big scale .
now it ' s on the red list of endangered species .
we ' ve heard many times about the galapagos or other places , and it ' s not very special .
yet we ' re still coming to the galapagos .
we re still thinking they ' re originally .
the papers still describe them as untouched .
what happened here ?
the second story is to illustrate another concept , the variable handle length .
because i experienced when studying a lagoon in west africa in 1971 .
i went there because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate .
and i got a bad sunburn , and i was convinced that i really didn ' t come from there .
it was my first sunburn .
as you can see , the lagoon was surrounded covered of palms and some mangroves .
there were that of about 20 - centimeter , black and bears , a sub species of minrs .
the fisheries these squid were very productive , and the fishermen lived very well on it and did extremely good in ghana .
when i returned 27 years later , the fish had declined to half its size .
they grow five centimeters .
they had been genetically clone .
there it was were still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish was also lucky to be there .
so nothing has changed , and yet everything has changed .
my third little story is about my lunch in the introduction of trawling in southeast asia .
in the ' 70s - rather at the beginning of the ' 60s - europe demanded a lot of development projects .
fishing meant countries that have already caught 100 , 000 fish , industrial fishing this rather ugly ship is called mutiara 4 .
i went on it , and we did surveys across over the southern south china sea , and especially in the java sea .
we didn ' have words for what we started there .
i know now that it was the reason of the sea .
90 percent of our catch were sponges , other animals that are related to the ground .
most of the fish , the little dots on the wreckage , the wreck pile , were coral reef fish .
basically , the bottom of the sea came on deck and then was thrown back .
these images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast .
within a year , you do a survey and then you start with commercial fishing .
the reason is changed . from - in this case - a hard reason or soft corals becomes muddy crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they weren ' t eaten , they threw them away because they were dead .
once we found a living .
she hadn ' t drowned yet .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of debris collected by fishermen they go to areas where they has never been fished .
but it ' s not documented .
we change the world , but we don ' t remember that .
wejust our norm values to the new level and we don ' t remember what was there .
if you generalize it , this is what happens .
on the y - axis there are some good things : biodiversity , the number of orca , the green of your country , the water supply .
over time , it changes . it changes , because for people , their actions are completely natural .
every generation looks at the images that they take at the beginning of their conscious lives as the standard and will derive all from it .
the difference is then seen as a loss .
but they don ' t notice the previous losses .
there can be a range of changes .
and at the end , they just want to preserve the horful remains .
that ' s our goal now .
we want to preserve things that have disappeared , or things that are no longer the way they were .
now you could think that the problem was about people who certainly , when they lived in predator societies , killing animals , and only realized after a few generations what they had done .
because obviously an animal that was very often becomes rarely before it emerges .
so you don ' t lose common animals .
you lose and more rare animals .
and that ' s why it ' s not seen as a big loss .
over time , we focus on the big animals , and in the sea these are the big fish .
they get less because we catch them .
over there ' s very little fish left over time , and we think that ' s the norm value .
the question is why people accept that .
well , because you don ' t know it was different .
of course , a lot of people , scientists , will confirm that it was really different .
they ' ll confirm it , because the evidence as you putlies in an earlier form is not the way you would like to demonstrate the evidence .
for example , there ' s the anecdote that a captain ' s soundso , who watched large of fish resources in this area , cannot be used , or is not fisher scientists because it ' s not " scientific . "
so we have a situation that people don ' t know the past , even though we live in educated societies , because they don ' t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormdououslys role that a marine reserve can play .
because through marine reserves , we ' re basically rectructing the past .
we retructing the past that people can ' t understand because the norm values have changed and they are very low .
so the people who see a marine reserve and benefit from the insight that allows them to res their norm values .
what about the people who don can ' t that because they don ' t have access - the people in the middle east , for example ?
here can , i think , the art and the film can fill the gap , and simulations .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there were gray whales - 500 years ago .
and the color colors and shades may remind you of " avatar . "
if you think about " avatar , " if you think about why people were touched by this - except the smallahoth story , why were they so touched by the image world ?
because it awets for something that has lost in some way lost .
so my recommendation , the only one i ' m going to give is to cameron to turn " avatar ii " underwater . "
thank you .
in the ' 1980s , in communist eastern germany , if you had a typewriter , you had to register it to the government .
they also had to register a sheet with example text from this typewriter .
the reason for that , the government could go back where a text came from .
if you found an article with wrong mind , you could find the creator of these thoughts .
and we in the west couldn ' t understand how anyonebody could do this , and how much that would limitring the freedom of speech .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
but if you buy a new color blow printer today from the leading laser printer and print a page , this page has put bright yellow spots on each page in a pattern that clearly allows the page track to you and your printer .
this is what happens us today .
and nobody seems to get upset about that .
and this was an example of how our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three main sources of online problems that exist today .
let ' s look at what ' s really happening in the world : we can divide the attacks into categories .
we have three main groups .
there are online criminals .
for example here , this is mr . dimitry golubowv from kansas in ukraine .
and the motive of online criminals are very easy to understand .
these people make money .
they use online attacks to make a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several known cases of online millionaires , multi - millionaires , who have made money from attacks .
this is stefan tsyatsten from tartu in estonia .
this is alfred gon .
stephen watt .
stefan sundasson .
this is matthew anderson , tariq al - dao and so on and so forth .
these people have come to wealth online , but they bought it illegally by using trojans , for example , to steal money from our bank accounts while we ' re doing our online banking , or keyloggers who collected our card details when we ' input through the keyboard while we ' re buying online through an a infected computer online .
the u . s . intelligence agency gott brought acquired the swiss account of mr . sam jain two months ago , and on that account there were 14 . 9 million u . s . dollars when it was frozen .
mr . jain himself is on free foot , the where is unknown .
and i am m saying that today ' is s more likely that we become victims of an online crime than a crime in the real world .
and it ' s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
in the future , most of crimes will be happen online .
the second largest attacker group that we can see today is not driven by money .
they ' re motivated by something else - protests like , an opinion , or by their audience .
groups like anonymous have stood up over the last 12 months and have become one of the key players in the field of online attacks .
so these are the three main groups : criminals are doing for money , hacktivists like anonymous who are res it , but the last group is nations , governments who are running the attacks .
we are cases , like the diginotar .
it shows examples of what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
diginotar is a full force sign from the netherlands - or it was that .
last fall it had to register ins , because diginotar had been hacked .
someone had crack ind andfully hacked the system .
and last week in a meeting with dutch government officials , i asked one of the leaders of this group if he thought it was possible that because of the diginor hack , people had died .
and his answer was , " yes . "
now , how do people die to this hack ?
diginotar is a certification site .
they sell certificates .
what do you do with certificates ?
well , you need a certificate if you have a website with htttbs , with ssl - encrypted services , like gmail .
now we all , or many of us , use googleil or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly common in totalitarian states like iran , where dissidents are using foreign companies like gmail , because they know that they can trust more than local providers and they ' re encodepted on ssl connection so the local government can ' t sniff around in their conversations .
but you can , if you enter in an foreign country .
fake certificate agency hacks and issue fake certifications .
and that ' s exactly what happened in the case of diginotar .
what about the arab spring and the things that happened in egypt , for example ?
now , in egypt in , april the insurgents steald the headquarters of egyptian intelligence police april 2011 , and they found a lot of documents .
in these files there was a folder called the finfisher .
and in this folder there were notes from a company in germany company that had sold to the egyptian government a few programs that enabled they could , on a very large scale , abs inter all the communication of the egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for 280 , 000 dollars to the egyptian government .
the corporate headquarters is right here .
so western governments provide totalitarian governments with tools so they to can fight against their own citizens .
but western governments are also help themselves .
for example , in germany , only a few weeks ago what so - called state tornadoan few , this was a trojan was used by german government officials to cover their own citizens .
if you ' re convicted in a crime case , pretty safe your phone is tapped .
but today we ' re way beyond that .
they tap their internet connection .
they use tools like the state drojan to play their computer with a trojan that allows them to monitor their entire communication , to listen their online discussions , collect their passwords .
so if we keep thinking about these things , people ' s obvious answer would be , " ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn ' t about me , because i ' m a brave citizen .
i don ' t have to worry !
i have nothing to hide . "
and that argument makes no sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not a debate .
it ' s not a decision between privacy and security .
it ' s a decision between freedom and control .
and while we today , in 2011 , like to trust our governments , every right we give is forever passed forever .
and do we trust , do we blind trust any future government , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we need to deal with for the next 50 years .
it may seem strange to you , but i ' m a big fan of concrete block blocks .
the first concrete building blocks were made in 1888 , and they came from a simple idea : modules of cement at certain dimensions that fit together .
concrete building blocks became very quickly the most used building unit in the world .
they got us to build things that were bigger than we did buildings , bridges , one rock after time .
basically , the concrete building had become the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out of this .
it was called the automatically connecting stone .
and within a few years , lego moved into every household .
it ' s estimated that over 400 billion stones have been produced - or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
you don ' t have to an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges , or beautiful buildings .
lego made it possible for everyone .
lego basically took the concrete building block , the building block of the world , and made it a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , the same year at bell labs , the next revolution was announced , the next building block .
the transistor was a little plastic unit of plastic that would take us from a world of static , stacked building blocks to a world in which everything would was interactive .
like the concrete block , the transistor allows us build much larger bigger , more complex cycles , one rock at a time .
but there ' s a main difference : the transistor was just for experts .
personally , i don ' t accept that the building block of our time is reserved for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing littlebits .
let me show you how they work .
littlebits are electronic modules that have a specific function .
they ' re preted to be light , sound , motor and sensor .
and the best part is that they connect to magnets .
so you can ' t put them wrong .
the stones are color - coded .
green is output , blue is electricity , pink is input , and orange is cable .
so all you have to do is connect a blue one and a green one , and you can build larger circles very quickly .
you add a blue one to a green one , and you can make light .
you can put a switch in between , and so you made a little dimer .
take the switch out to ins plug in a pulse , which is here , and you made a little flash .
add this buzzer for additional effect , and you made a noise machine .
i ' ll stop that .
beyond simple playing , littlebits is actually quite powerful .
instead of having to program , wire or stack , littlebits allows to program with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to accelerate or slow the pulse , just turn on this button , and it makes the pulse faster or slow down .
the idea behind littlebits is that it ' s a growing library .
we want to bring put every single interaction in the world into a usen stone .
lights , sounds , solar elements , motors - everything should be available .
we distributed littlebits to kids and we saw them play playing with them .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is how they begin to understand the electronics that aroundround around everyday life and they don ' t learn in school .
like , for example how a nightlight works , or why the doors of the elevator remain open , or how an ipod responds to touch .
we ' also brought littlebits to design schools .
so for example , we had designers with had no experience in electronic things that started playing with littlebits as a material .
here we see , with sponge , paper and water bottles , like geoylly .
a few weeks ago , we brought littlebits to risd , and gave them to some designers who had no technical experience - just cardboard , wood and paper - and told them , " do something . "
here ' s an example of a project they did , a motion - controlled conti cannon .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
it ' s a play - dough that ' s scared in the dark .
for these non - engineers , littlebits became another material , electronics just became another material .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
so littlebits is open source .
you can go to the website , downloadload all the design specifications and make them yourself .
we want to encourage the world of the creators , the inventor , the contributors , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , belongs to us .
so , move out and start inventng them .
thank you .
